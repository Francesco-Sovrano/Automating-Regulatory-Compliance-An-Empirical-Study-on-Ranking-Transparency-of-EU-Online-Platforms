Why were specific parameters selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?,Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?,2,3,5,Y-4,N-2,"Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Quality and credibility of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. User engagement considers how users interact with search results. Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information on the page is. Location takes into account the user's location, where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. Page load time is important as slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave a website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result (paragraph 2).",0.45,0.83,0.54

What are the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment (if any)?,Does the documentation explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment (if any)?,5,4,4,Y-4,N-2,"Yes, the documentation explains the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment. In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 0 and 4). However, Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment (paragraph 1 and 2). Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, but they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing (paragraph 2). Ad position, which is where ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page, is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including the amount you bid for your keyword, your ad's relevance, and your ad's performance (paragraph 8).",0.49,0.88,0.56
What is the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services?,Does the documentation explain the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services?,1,1,5,N-2,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation explains the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing uses complex algorithms and machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals (paragraph 2). The ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content (paragraph 4). The ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity (paragraph 5). Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including the amount you bid for your keyword, your ad's relevance, and your ad's performance, based on various response signalsâ€”for example, click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 7). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 8).",0.45,0.91,0.5

Bing's complex algorithms generate search results using the user's search query, matching it with third-party webpages in their index. The relevance of the content on the landing page to the search query is a key parameter in ranking pages in search results. However, the characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 1, 5, 3). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 2, 12).",0.55,0.87,0.63
What is the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?,Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?,1,2,4,Y-4,N-2,"Yes, the documentation explains the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. Bing's ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the content on the landing page to the search query, including matching terms and semantic equivalents (paragraph 2). The quality and credibility of a website are evaluated based on factors such as the clarity of the site's purpose, its usability, presentation, authoritativeness, and the completeness of the content (paragraph 2). User engagement is also considered, including how users interact with search results and their behavior on the webpages (paragraph 2). Other factors include the freshness of the content, the user's location, the page load time, and the location of other visitors to the page (paragraph 2). The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 6).

They can also stand out by sharing images, product ratings, and promotions of the products they're selling (paragraph 4, 8). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 7, 11). Users can also optimize their keyword bids to improve performance and increase their ROI (paragraph 12, 18).
