What is the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking?,Does the documentation provide the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking?,2,2,3,Y-4,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation provides the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking. The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 0) and takes into consideration a variety of factors (paragraph 5). For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 1, 12). The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 6). User interaction also plays a role in ranking, for example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering (paragraph 3, 4). Numeric ratings also play a role in the ranking, with the closer the numeric rating is to bestRating, the more true it is; the closer this value is to worstRating, the more false it is (paragraph 8, 14).",0.58,1.03,0.56
What are the main parameters used for determining ranking?,Does the documentation provide the main parameters used for determining ranking?,3,3,4,Y-4,Y-5,"Yes, the documentation provides the main parameters used for determining ranking. These include the completeness of the required properties for each enriched search type (paragraph 15), the relevance of the marked up data to the enriched search (paragraph 15), and the number of user clicks a given provider link receives in the knowledge panel (paragraph 10). Other factors include the presence of explicitly stated salaries in job postings (paragraph 2), the presence of actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 1), and the ability for users to filter job postings by salaries (paragraph 15). The documentation also mentions that the order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, and that different users may see different orderings (paragraph 13).",0.58,1.04,0.56
Why were specific parameters selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?,Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?,4,4,3,Y-4,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. The parameters are selected based on their relevance and completeness. For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search (paragraph 2). The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 4, 7, 8). For example, users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 13).",0.47,0.99,0.47
"What is the business logic behind allowing users to affect the ranking of their products or services through payments, and what are the potential consequences of this?","Does the documentation explain what the business logic behind allowing users to affect the ranking of their products or services through payments is, and what the potential consequences of this are?",1,1,1,Y-4,N-2,"No, I cannot answer.",0,0,0
What is most important in determining ranking?,Does the documentation explain what is most important in determining ranking?,4,3,3,Y-4,4.5,"Yes, the documentation explains that ranking is determined by a variety of factors. These include the completeness and relevance of the data provided, with more complete and relevant data leading to higher quality results for users (paragraph 18). For example, for job postings, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries (paragraph 18, 4). For recipes, actual user reviews and genuine star ratings are valuable (paragraph 18, 13). The documentation also mentions that user behavior, such as clicking on a provider link in the knowledge panel often, can affect the positioning of a provider in an ordering (paragraph 5, 8).",0.45,0.88,0.51
What are the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment (if any)?,Does the documentation explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment (if any)?,1,1,1,Y-4,N-2,"No, the documentation does not explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment. It does, however, explain that ranking can be influenced by factors such as explicitly stated salaries (paragraph 0, 2, 7, 9), user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 2, 7, 9, 11), and the frequency with which a user clicks a given provider link (paragraph 6, 12). The documentation also states that job postings requiring payment from applicants are not allowed (paragraph 4).",0,0,0
What is the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services?,Does the documentation explain the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services?,1,3,2,N-2,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation does explain the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, and a variety of factors affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering (paragraph 0).

"What is the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?","Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?",2,1,2,Y-4,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The enriched search ranking takes into consideration the completeness and relevance of the marked up data. For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and the ranking mechanism takes this into account. Similarly, if recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users and is considered in the ranking. The ranking mechanism also considers the relevance of the data to the enriched search. For example, a sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events or a woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes would be considered irrelevant (paragraph 0). The ranking also takes into consideration extra information such as customer reviews, ratings, shipping costs, availability data, return information, and price drops (paragraph 7). However, it is more important to provide fewer but complete and accurate recommended properties rather than trying to provide every possible recommended property with less complete, badly-formed, or inaccurate data (paragraph 5).",0.41,0.77,0.53
What is the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?,Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?,1,1,3,Y-4,N-2,"Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. The enriched search ranking algorithm can exclude a site from enriched search results if it decides that a large part of the site is not meeting the quality bar (paragraph 1). The ranking mechanism also takes into account the completeness and relevance of the marked up data on a site (paragraph 4). For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 4). The ranking mechanism also considers whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request (paragraph 6). Google's generation of site names on the Google Search results page is completely automated and takes into account both the content of a site and references to it that appear on the web (paragraph 7).",0.33,0.74,0.44
What is the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?,Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?,1,1,2,Y-4,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. For instance, the more additional (recommended) properties provided, the higher quality the item is to users, which influences its ranking (paragraph 0, 1, 19). For job postings, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries, and the ranking mechanism takes this into consideration (paragraph 0, 1, 14). Similarly, for recipes, actual user reviews and genuine star ratings are valuable to users and influence the ranking (paragraph 0, 1, 14). Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability (paragraph 3, 8). Other factors that can influence the ranking include customer reviews, ratings, shipping costs, product availability, and return policy (paragraph 10).",0.54,1.01,0.53
"What are the effects of payments, on ranking (if any)?","Does the documentation explain the effects of payments, on ranking (if any)?",1,1,1,Y-4,N-2,"Yes, the documentation does explain the effects of payments on ranking. It states that for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 0, 2, 16). It also mentions that when users apply a filter for salaries, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank (paragraph 5). However, it also warns that general user satisfaction starts to degrade significantly when paywalls are shown more than 10% of the time, which could potentially affect user engagement and indirectly influence ranking (paragraph 1, 3, 8, 18).",0.4,0.87,0.46
How can users improve the ranking of their goods or services?,Does the documentation explain how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services?,4,3,3,Y-4,Y-4,"Yes, the documentation explains how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services. Users can enhance the appearance of their search result by providing customer reviews and ratings, identifying pros and cons in their product review description, sharing shipping costs, providing availability data, and sharing return information (paragraph 0). Users should also mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item with schema.org/AggregateRating and make sure the reviews and ratings are readily available to users from the marked-up page (paragraph 2). The documentation also suggests that the more recommended properties that users provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 3). Users should also provide information such as reviewer ratings, cooking and preparation times, and nutrition information (paragraph 5). The documentation also suggests that users should provide as many additional (recommended) properties as possible, as this increases the quality of the item to users (paragraph 6).",0.53,1.08,0.49

The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 0). The more recommended properties provided, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 1). For example, users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without (paragraph 1, 7, 14). The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, with factors such as user clicks on a given provider link affecting the ordering (paragraph 2, 3). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration (paragraph 1, 4). Ratings are also important, with Google assuming by default that a site uses a 5-point scale (paragraph 5). If the enriched search ranking algorithm decides that a large part of a site is not meeting the quality bar, it can exclude the entire site from enriched search results (paragraph 10). The Google algorithm programmatically determines the eligibility for fact check rich results, depending on many variables (paragraph 13). The documentation also mentions the importance of user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 14).",0.82,1.12,0.74
