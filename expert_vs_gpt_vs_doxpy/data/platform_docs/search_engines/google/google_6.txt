Sitelinks

Sitelinks are links from the same domain that are clustered together under a web result. Our systems analyze the link structure of your site to find shortcuts that will save users time and allow them to quickly find the information they're looking for.

Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different.

We only show sitelinks for results when we think they'll be useful to the user. If the structure of your site doesn't allow our algorithms to find good sitelinks, or we don't think that the sitelinks for your site are relevant for the user's query, we won't show them.
Sitelinks best practices

At the moment, sitelinks are automated. We're always working to improve our sitelinks algorithms, and we may incorporate site owner input in the future. There are best practices you can follow, however, to improve the quality of your sitelinks.

    Make sure that the text you use as your page titles and in your headings is informative, relevant, and compact.
    Create a logical site structure that is easy for users to navigate, and make sure you link to your important pages from other relevant pages.
    Ensure that your internal links' anchor text is concise and relevant to the page they're pointing to.
    Avoid repetitions in your content.

If you need to remove a sitelink, consider removing the page from your site or using noindex.
