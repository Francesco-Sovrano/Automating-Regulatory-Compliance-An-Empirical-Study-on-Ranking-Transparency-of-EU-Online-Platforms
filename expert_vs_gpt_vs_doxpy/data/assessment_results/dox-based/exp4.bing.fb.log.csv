"Does the documentation explain how ""ranking"" is defined/define ""ranking""?",0.41,0.85,0.48,"Yes, the documentation explains how ""ranking"" is defined. In the context of ad placement, ranking is determined by multiple factors including the amount bid for a keyword, the ad's relevance, and the ad's performance based on various response signals such as click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 0). In the context of Bing search results, ranking is determined by complex algorithms that use machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. The main parameters used to rank pages in search results include relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time (paragraph 1).","0.

1. ""Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience."",

8. ""The keyword research tool takes a root keyword as input to suggest matching and other relevant keywords. The tool has a search box on top where you can input the root keyword that you want to research. By default, the tool also lists a set of keywords that are bringing traffic to websites and the corresponding search volume trend.

Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere.

Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience."",
4. ""Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity."",
5. ""The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \""Strict\"" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority."",

"Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism works and, in particular, what the main parameters used are?",0.51,0.85,0.6,"Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism works and the main parameters used. The ranking mechanism is based on complex algorithms that use machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. The main parameters used to rank pages in search results, listed in general order of importance, are:","0. ""Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience."",

QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience."",

14. ""Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3.

15. ""The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \""Strict\"" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority."",
