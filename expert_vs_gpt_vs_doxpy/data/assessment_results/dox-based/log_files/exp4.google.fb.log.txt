Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",

Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs.

If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.

If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in.

Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",

If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in.

Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages.

A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs.

Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs.

If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.

If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries.

By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale.

    "For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration.",
    "Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation.",
    "This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how "main parameter used for ranking" is defined. The main parameters used for ranking include the completeness of the required properties, the relevance of the marked up data, and the content policies. For example, in a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search (paragraph 8).

<Question> Does the documentation provide the main parameters used for determining ranking?
<Answers> [
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration.",
    "Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "For more information, see Rating. url",
    "In order for your site's \"top places\" list to be eligible to appear in a Top Places List result, the list must meet these criteria:",
    "For numeric ratings, the best value possible in the scale from worst to best. Must be greater than worstRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Example: 4 name",
    "Specify a salary range or salary estimates based on the percentile rank.",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.",
    "There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "For numeric ratings, the worst value possible in a scale from worst to best. Must be less than bestRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Must have a minimum value of 1. Example: 1 Monitor rich results with Search Console",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "Users must be able to post their own ratings on your site and your site must host those user ratings. The number of ratings must reflect actual ratings that users provide. The aggregate score must be accurately derived from the provided ratings.",
    "When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank.",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation."

Creating cache <./cache/cache_exp4_google/qa_embedder-edu_amr_clause.pkl>..
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the main parameters used for determining ranking. These include the completeness of the required properties for each enriched search type (paragraph 15), the relevance of the marked up data to the enriched search (paragraph 15), and the number of user clicks a given provider link receives in the knowledge panel (paragraph 10). Other factors include the presence of explicitly stated salaries in job postings (paragraph 2), the presence of actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 1), and the ability for users to filter job postings by salaries (paragraph 15). The documentation also mentions that the order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, and that different users may see different orderings (paragraph 13).

    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.",
    "The closer the numeric rating is to bestRating, the more true it is; the closer this value is to worstRating, the more false it is.",
    "For more information, see Rating. url",
    "For numeric ratings, the best value possible in the scale from worst to best. Must be greater than worstRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Example: 4 name",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",

Example: 4 worstRating",
    "Specify a salary range or salary estimates based on the percentile rank.",
    "It is important to document such rating schemes to clarify the meaning of the numeric ratings.",
    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",
    "Different fact-checking projects have a variety of rating schemes which can have subtle differences, particularly for intermediate values.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking. The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 0) and takes into consideration a variety of factors (paragraph 5). For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 1, 12). The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 6). User interaction also plays a role in ranking, for example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering (paragraph 3, 4). Numeric ratings also play a role in the ranking, with the closer the numeric rating is to bestRating, the more true it is; the closer this value is to worstRating, the more false it is (paragraph 8, 14).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?
<Answers> [
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "Follow the merchant listing structured data requirements to maximize the eligibility of your pages selling products in shopping experiences in search results.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability. Only pages from which a shopper can purchase a product are eligible for merchant listing experiences, not pages with links to other sites that sell the product. Google may attempt to verify merchant listing product data before showing the information in search results.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "They are used for products and product reviews, and can include additional information such as ratings, review information, price, and availability.",
    "Users can see price, availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results.",
    "The merchant listing experiences are: Popular products",
    "The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users.",
    "When users search for a type of business (for example, \"best NYC restaurants\")",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "Make sure to mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item by many people with schema.org/AggregateRating. Google may display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in search results. Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or schema.org/Recipe, or by using a schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property. Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content. Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of items. If you include multiple individual reviews, also include an aggregate rating of the individual reviews. Don't aggregate reviews or ratings from other websites. If the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines: If the entity that's being reviewed controls the reviews about itself, their pages that use LocalBusiness or any other type of Organization structured data are ineligible for star review feature. For example, a review about entity A is placed on the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an embedded third-party widget (for example, Google Business reviews or Facebook reviews widget). For more information, check out our blog post on why we added this guideline and our FAQ about the change. Ratings must be sourced directly from users. Don't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for local businesses.",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "For sites that capture reviews about other local businesses: The average rating of the local business based on multiple ratings or reviews. Follow the Review snippet guidelines and the list of required and recommended aggregate rating properties. department"

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The ranking mechanism takes into account the completeness of the properties provided for each item, with items having more additional (recommended) properties being of higher quality to users (paragraph 0, 1, 14). For instance, job postings with explicitly stated salaries or recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings are considered more valuable (paragraph 0, 1). The ranking also considers the relevance of the marked-up data to the enriched search (paragraph 0). For merchant listings, specific data about a product such as its price and availability are important (paragraph 6, 7). Customer reviews, ratings, shipping costs, product availability, price drop information, and return policy are also considered in the ranking mechanism (paragraph 5). The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 2).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?
<Answers> [
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability. Only pages from which a shopper can purchase a product are eligible for merchant listing experiences, not pages with links to other sites that sell the product. Google may attempt to verify merchant listing product data before showing the information in search results.",
    "Follow the merchant listing structured data requirements to maximize the eligibility of your pages selling products in shopping experiences in search results.",
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",

    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",

    "If your site publishes user-generated ratings about hiring organizations, add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your site. EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google. During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to EmployerAggregateRating structured data soon. Employer rating example in search results Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test. Example",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Users can see price, availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results.",
    "The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. For instance, the more additional (recommended) properties provided, the higher quality the item is to users, which influences its ranking (paragraph 0, 1, 19). For job postings, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries, and the ranking mechanism takes this into consideration (paragraph 0, 1, 14). Similarly, for recipes, actual user reviews and genuine star ratings are valuable to users and influence the ranking (paragraph 0, 1, 14). Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability (paragraph 3, 8). Other factors that can influence the ranking include customer reviews, ratings, shipping costs, product availability, and return policy (paragraph 10).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability. Only pages from which a shopper can purchase a product are eligible for merchant listing experiences, not pages with links to other sites that sell the product. Google may attempt to verify merchant listing product data before showing the information in search results.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "Follow the merchant listing structured data requirements to maximize the eligibility of your pages selling products in shopping experiences in search results.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability.",
    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "They are used for products and product reviews, and can include additional information such as ratings, review information, price, and availability.",
    "The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users.",
    "However, it is more important to supply fewer but complete and accurate recommended properties rather than trying to provide every possible recommended property with less complete, badly-formed, or inaccurate data.",
    "This form of pricing is particularly important in the EU for products sold by volume or weight.",
    "The merchant listing experiences are: Popular products",
    "If your site publishes user-generated ratings about hiring organizations, add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your site. EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google. During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to EmployerAggregateRating structured data soon. Employer rating example in search results Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test. Example",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Users can see price, availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The enriched search ranking takes into consideration the completeness and relevance of the marked up data. For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users and enriched search (paragraph 0). The ranking also takes into account additional properties such as customer reviews and ratings, shipping costs, availability data, return information, and price changes over time (paragraph 2). The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, and a variety of factors affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering (paragraph 3).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "However, it is more important to supply fewer but complete and accurate recommended properties rather than trying to provide every possible recommended property with less complete, badly-formed, or inaccurate data.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability. Only pages from which a shopper can purchase a product are eligible for merchant listing experiences, not pages with links to other sites that sell the product. Google may attempt to verify merchant listing product data before showing the information in search results.",
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",
    "Merchant listing experiences rely on more specific data about a product, such as its price and availability.",
    "Follow the merchant listing structured data requirements to maximize the eligibility of your pages selling products in shopping experiences in search results.",

EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google. During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to EmployerAggregateRating structured data soon.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The enriched search ranking takes into consideration the completeness and relevance of the marked up data. For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and the ranking mechanism takes this into account. Similarly, if recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users and is considered in the ranking. The ranking mechanism also considers the relevance of the data to the enriched search. For example, a sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events or a woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes would be considered irrelevant (paragraph 0). The ranking also takes into consideration extra information such as customer reviews, ratings, shipping costs, availability data, return information, and price drops (paragraph 7). However, it is more important to provide fewer but complete and accurate recommended properties rather than trying to provide every possible recommended property with less complete, badly-formed, or inaccurate data (paragraph 5).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?
<Answers> [
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "If the enriched search ranking algorithm decides that a large part of a site is not meeting the quality bar, it can exclude the entire site from enriched search results.",
    "Google systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request, and if so, elevates it.",
    "By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Google's generation of site names on the Google Search results page is completely automated and takes into account both the content of a site and references to it that appear on the web.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "Enriched search is driven by the Google Search ranking algorithm; in addition to adding the correct structured data on your pages, you must follow the following quality guidelines so that Google can properly index and rank your pages.",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation.",
    "Make sure to mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item by many people with schema.org/AggregateRating. Google may display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in search results. Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or schema.org/Recipe, or by using a schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property. Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content. Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of items. If you include multiple individual reviews, also include an aggregate rating of the individual reviews. Don't aggregate reviews or ratings from other websites. If the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines: If the entity that's being reviewed controls the reviews about itself, their pages that use LocalBusiness or any other type of Organization structured data are ineligible for star review feature. For example, a review about entity A is placed on the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an embedded third-party widget (for example, Google Business reviews or Facebook reviews widget). For more information, check out our blog post on why we added this guideline and our FAQ about the change. Ratings must be sourced directly from users. Don't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for local businesses.",
    "Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "You can't. Google systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request, and if so, elevates it. What happens when a user clicks a featured snippet?",
    "Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "The Google algorithm tailors search results to create what it thinks is the best search experience for a user, depending on many variables, including search history, location, and device type.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "For example, if your restaurant appears in a \"Top 10 Chinese restaurants in NYC\" list and a \"Best restaurants in the city\" list on qualified websites, these lists would be shown in your business's search result.",
    "Google uses structured data to understand the content on the page and show that content in a richer appearance in search results, which is called a rich result. To make your site eligible for appearance as one of these rich results, follow the guide to learn how to implement structured data on your site. If you're just getting started, visit Understand how structured data works. Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 0) and takes into account the quality of the site, including whether it meets certain quality bars (paragraph 1). The ranking algorithm also considers the completeness and relevance of the marked up data on the site (paragraph 4). For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and the enriched search ranking takes this into consideration (paragraph 4). The ranking also considers the availability of user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 4). The ranking mechanism also takes into account the content of a site and references to it that appear on the web (paragraph 8). The ranking can also be influenced by user behavior, such as how often a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel (paragraph 9). The ranking mechanism also considers whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request (paragraph 2).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?
<Answers> [
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "If the enriched search ranking algorithm decides that a large part of a site is not meeting the quality bar, it can exclude the entire site from enriched search results.",
    "Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "Google systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request, and if so, elevates it.",
    "Google's generation of site names on the Google Search results page is completely automated and takes into account both the content of a site and references to it that appear on the web.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Enriched search is driven by the Google Search ranking algorithm; in addition to adding the correct structured data on your pages, you must follow the following quality guidelines so that Google can properly index and rank your pages.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "For example, if your restaurant appears in a \"Top 10 Chinese restaurants in NYC\" list and a \"Best restaurants in the city\" list on qualified websites, these lists would be shown in your business's search result.",
    "Here are some case studies of websites that have implemented structured data for their site:",
    "In order to better understand the potential impact of sampling changes on Google users and publishers' subscription models, we developed a series of experiments in cooperation with our publishing partners. From these experiments we learned that even minor changes to the current sampling levels could degrade user experience and, as user access is restricted, unintentionally impact article ranking in Google Search.",
    "In order for your site's \"top places\" list to be eligible to appear in a Top Places List result, the list must meet these criteria:",
    "The Google algorithm tailors search results to create what it thinks is the best search experience for a user, depending on many variables, including search history, location, and device type.",
    "You can't. Google systems determine whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request, and if so, elevates it. What happens when a user clicks a featured snippet?",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. The enriched search ranking algorithm can exclude a site from enriched search results if it decides that a large part of the site is not meeting the quality bar (paragraph 1). The ranking mechanism also takes into account the completeness and relevance of the marked up data on a site (paragraph 4). For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 4). The ranking mechanism also considers whether a page would make a good featured snippet for a user's search request (paragraph 6). Google's generation of site names on the Google Search results page is completely automated and takes into account both the content of a site and references to it that appear on the web (paragraph 7).

<Final Answer> No, the documentation does not explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment. It does, however, explain that ranking can be influenced by factors such as explicitly stated salaries (paragraph 0, 2, 7, 9), user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 2, 7, 9, 11), and the frequency with which a user clicks a given provider link (paragraph 6, 12). The documentation also states that job postings requiring payment from applicants are not allowed (paragraph 4).

    "Bear in mind that our user studies have shown that when users who have experienced only a small amount of content are required to subscribe, their interest in the product diminishes greatly. Our analysis shows that general user satisfaction starts to degrade significantly when paywalls are shown more than 10% of the time (which generally means that about 3% of the audience has been exposed to the paywall). We recommend caution in approaching that limit, because you may start to alienate users who have not yet become convinced of the value of your content.",

Monthly metering also has the advantage of focusing paywall views on your most engaged users, who are those most likely to subscribe, while allowing your newer and less engaged users to become acquainted with the value of your content before experiencing a paywall. (\"Paywall,\" in this context, applies equally to barriers that require either subscription or merely registration for content access.) How much content?",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation does explain the effects of payments on ranking. It states that for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration (paragraph 0, 2, 16). It also mentions that when users apply a filter for salaries, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank (paragraph 5). However, it also warns that general user satisfaction starts to degrade significantly when paywalls are shown more than 10% of the time, which could potentially affect user engagement and indirectly influence ranking (paragraph 1, 3, 8, 18).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism works and, in particular, what the main parameters used are?
<Answers> [
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "For more information about how Google ranks articles, see How Search works.",
    "For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration.",
    "In order for your site's \"top places\" list to be eligible to appear in a Top Places List result, the list must meet these criteria:",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation.",
    "If the enriched search ranking algorithm decides that a large part of a site is not meeting the quality bar, it can exclude the entire site from enriched search results.",
    "When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank.",
    "This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.",
    "The Google algorithm programmatically determines the eligibility for fact check rich results, depending on many variables, including the following guidelines.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "Users must be able to post their own ratings on your site and your site must host those user ratings. The number of ratings must reflect actual ratings that users provide. The aggregate score must be accurately derived from the provided ratings.",
    "The lowest value allowed in this rating system. If worstRating is omitted, 1 is assumed. AggregateRating",
    "Specify a salary range or salary estimates based on the percentile rank.",
    "A top answer to the question. There can be zero or more of these per question. This must represent answers that are accepted in some way on your site. For example, accepted as a top answer by question asker, a moderator, or a voting system. Other forms of sorting answers, such as most-recent, must not be used to identify top answers. suggestedAnswer Answer",
    "Employer rating example in search results Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism works and the main parameters used. The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 0). The more recommended properties provided, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 1). For example, users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without (paragraph 1, 7, 14). The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, with factors such as user clicks on a given provider link affecting the ordering (paragraph 2, 3). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration (paragraph 1, 4). Ratings are also important, with Google assuming by default that a site uses a 5-point scale (paragraph 5). If the enriched search ranking algorithm decides that a large part of a site is not meeting the quality bar, it can exclude the entire site from enriched search results (paragraph 10). The Google algorithm programmatically determines the eligibility for fact check rich results, depending on many variables (paragraph 13). The documentation also mentions the importance of user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 14).

<Question> Does the documentation explain what is most important in determining ranking?
<Answers> [
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search.",
    "Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering.",
    "In order for your site's \"top places\" list to be eligible to appear in a Top Places List result, the list must meet these criteria:",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "To ensure that your books can be reliably surfaced in Search, it's important that you're familiar with some important details and key concepts.",
    "When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank.",
    "Put the structured data on the page that it describes, unless specified otherwise by the documentation.",
    "If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "Specify a salary range or salary estimates based on the percentile rank.",
    "We will prioritize key moments set by you, either through structured data or the YouTube description.",
    "For numeric ratings, the best value possible in the scale from worst to best. Must be greater than worstRating. Must be able to be evaluated as a number. Example: 4 name",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that ranking is determined by a variety of factors. These include the completeness and relevance of the data provided, with more complete and relevant data leading to higher quality results for users (paragraph 18). For example, for job postings, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries (paragraph 18, 4). For recipes, actual user reviews and genuine star ratings are valuable (paragraph 18, 13). The documentation also mentions that user behavior, such as clicking on a provider link in the knowledge panel often, can affect the positioning of a provider in an ordering (paragraph 5, 8).

<Question> Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering.",
    "This form of pricing is particularly important in the EU for products sold by volume or weight.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user. This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order. Get started",
    "The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users.",
    "They are used for products and product reviews, and can include additional information such as ratings, review information, price, and availability.",
    "However, it is more important to supply fewer but complete and accurate recommended properties rather than trying to provide every possible recommended property with less complete, badly-formed, or inaccurate data.",
    "The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration.",
    "Here is an example of how to specify a price for 4.5l of a product that is always sold in multiples of 750ml. This form of pricing is particularly important in the EU for products sold by volume or weight.",

    "In order for your site's \"top places\" list to be eligible to appear in a Top Places List result, the list must meet these criteria:",
    "Users can see price, availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "A numerical quality rating for the item, either a number, fraction, or percentage (for example, 4, 60%, or 6 / 10). Google understands the scale for fractions and percentages, since the scale is implied in the fraction itself or the percentage. The default scale for numbers is a 5-point scale, where 1 is the lowest value and 5 is the highest value. If another scale is intended, use bestRating and worstRating.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. The parameters are selected based on their relevance and completeness. For instance, for a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search (paragraph 2). The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 4, 7, 8). For example, users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 13).

This means different users see different orderings, and the same user might see different orderings at different times. There are a variety of factors that affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering. There's no way to control the order.

For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation does explain the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The order of providers in the knowledge panel is personalized and dynamic to each user, and a variety of factors affect a given ordering. For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering (paragraph 0). The ranking is determined algorithmically (paragraph 3). 

For enriched search, each type defines a required set of properties and items missing these properties are ineligible. The more additional (recommended) properties provided, the higher quality the item is to users. For instance, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. The marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search being participated in (paragraph 5). 

For product reviews, providing customer reviews and ratings, identifying pros and cons in the product review description, sharing shipping costs, providing availability data, sharing return information, and observing price changes for the product over time are all factors that can enhance the appearance of the search result (paragraph 7). 

For rich results, items that are missing required properties are not eligible. The more recommended properties provided, the higher quality the result is to users. For example, users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (paragraph 10).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "Ratings: Enhance the appearance of your search result by providing customer reviews and ratings. Pros and Cons: Identify pros and cons in your product review description so they can be highlighted in search results. Shipping: Share shipping costs, especially free shipping, so shoppers understand the total cost. Availability: Provide availability data to help customers know when you currently have a product in stock. Price drop: Price drops are computed by Google by observing price changes for the product over time. Price drops are not guaranteed to be shown. Returns: Share return information, such as your return policy, fees involved in returns, and how many days customers have to return a product.",
    "It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google.",
    "Make sure to mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item by many people with schema.org/AggregateRating. Google may display aggregate ratings as rich snippets or, for certain types of items, answers in search results. Refer clearly to a specific product or service by nesting the review within the markup of another schema.org type, such as schema.org/Book or schema.org/Recipe, or by using a schema.org type as a value for the itemReviewed property. Make sure the reviews and ratings you mark up are readily available to users from the marked-up page. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has review content. Provide review information about a specific item, not about a category or a list of items. If you include multiple individual reviews, also include an aggregate rating of the individual reviews. Don't aggregate reviews or ratings from other websites. If the review snippet is for a local business or an organization, you must follow these additional guidelines: If the entity that's being reviewed controls the reviews about itself, their pages that use LocalBusiness or any other type of Organization structured data are ineligible for star review feature. For example, a review about entity A is placed on the website of entity A, either directly in their structured data or through an embedded third-party widget (for example, Google Business reviews or Facebook reviews widget). For more information, check out our blog post on why we added this guideline and our FAQ about the change. Ratings must be sourced directly from users. Don't rely on human editors to create, curate, or compile ratings information for local businesses.",
    "Specify all required properties listed in the documentation for your specific rich result type. Items that are missing required properties are not eligible for rich results. The more recommended properties that you provide, the higher quality the result is to users. For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action). Rich result ranking takes extra information into consideration.",
    "Users can see price, availability, review ratings, shipping information, and more right in search results.",
    "When you provide information such as reviewer ratings, cooking and preparation times, and nutrition information, Google can better understand your recipe and present it to users in interesting ways.",
    "Required properties: Each enriched search type defines a required set of properties. Items missing the required properties are ineligible. Completeness: The more additional (recommended) properties you provide, the higher quality the item is to our users. For a job posting, users prefer jobs with explicitly stated salaries than those without, and enriched search ranking also takes this into consideration. If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search. In addition, enriched search offers structured exploration for users; for instance users can filter the list of jobs by salaries. When user apply this filter, a job posting without salaries will not be able to rank. This is one of the most important ranking signals for enriched search. Relevance: Your marked up data must be relevant to the enriched search you are participating in. Here are some examples of irrelevant data: A sports live streaming site labeling broadcasts as local events. A woodworking site labeling instructions as recipes. Leaf content: Enriched search is only available for leaf pages, not for listing pages. A leaf page is a page that describes the detailed properties of an item. A listing page, on the other hand, is a category page that links to multiple leaf pages. The following are examples of listing pages: A page that describes \"10 best ideas for cooking turkey\" with links out to each recipe. A page listing all the jobs at Mountain View, CA, with links to individual jobs. Content policies: Individual enriched search has additional content-type-specific policies for each data type, as described in its documentation. Documents or sites that violate these content policies may receive less favorable ranking or ineligible for the feature.",
    "For example, if a user clicks a given provider link in the knowledge panel often, that provider is more likely to be positioned higher in an ordering.",
    "For example: users prefer job postings with explicitly stated salaries than those without; users prefer recipes with actual user reviews and genuine star ratings (note that reviews or ratings not by actual users may result in manual action).",
    "The merchant listing experiences are: Popular products",
    "If your site publishes user-generated ratings about hiring organizations, add EmployerAggregateRating structured data to your site. EmployerAggregateRating is an evaluation of a hiring organization compiled from many users. Adding EmployerAggregateRating can provide job seekers with ratings about a hiring organization to help them choose a job. It also offers prominent brand placement in the enriched job search experience on Google. During the beta phase, we recommended adding review snippet structured data for your page to be eligible for the jobs enriched search results. If you currently have review snippet structured data on your site, we recommend that you transition from review snippet structured data to EmployerAggregateRating structured data soon. Employer rating example in search results Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test. Example",
    "Providing both structured data on web pages and a Merchant Center feed will maximize your eligibility to experiences and help Google correctly understand and verify your data.",
    "When users search for businesses on Google Search or Maps, Search results may display a prominent Google knowledge panel with details about a business that matched the query. When users search for a type of business (for example, \"best NYC restaurants\"), they may see a carousel of businesses related to the query. With Local Business structured data, you can tell Google about your business hours, different departments within a business, reviews for your business, and more. If you want to help users to make a reservation or place an order directly in Search results, you can use the Maps Booking API to enable bookings, payments, and other actions. How to add structured data",
    "If you're still having trouble, it may be because ranking is determined algorithmically.",
    "Make sure that the ratings are available to users from the page where you add EmployerAggregateRating structured data. It must be immediately obvious to users that the page has rating content. Provide rating information about a specific hiring organization, not about a category or a list of items. For example, \"top 10 best places to work\" and \"tech companies\" aren't specific hiring organizations. By default, Google assumes that your site uses a 5-point scale, where 5 is the best possible rating and 1 is the worst, but you can use any other scale. If you use a different scale, you can specify the best and worst ratings, and Google scales that to the 5-star system.",
    "If your recipes have actual user reviews and genuine star ratings, that is also valuable to users of your site and enriched search.",
    "You can improve the job seeking experience by adding JobPosting structured data to your job posting web pages. Adding structured data makes your job postings eligible to appear in a special user experience in Google Search results. You can also integrate with Google by using a third party job site. An illustration of how the job posting experience can appear in Google Search results",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services. Users can enhance the appearance of their search result by providing customer reviews and ratings, identifying pros and cons in their product review description, sharing shipping costs, providing availability data, and sharing return information (paragraph 0). Users should also mark up an aggregate evaluation of an item with schema.org/AggregateRating and make sure the reviews and ratings are readily available to users from the marked-up page (paragraph 2). The documentation also suggests that the more recommended properties that users provide, the higher quality the result is to users (paragraph 3). Users should also provide information such as reviewer ratings, cooking and preparation times, and nutrition information (paragraph 5). The documentation also suggests that users should provide as many additional (recommended) properties as possible, as this increases the quality of the item to users (paragraph 6).
