They start searching for and exploring destinations, property types, particular facilities (e.g. swimming pools), prices and dates. 2. Compare - they've decided what their needs are. They start comparing different available accommodation, weighing up which one best fulfills their needs. 3. Book - having chosen the accommodation that best matches their preferences, they make a reservation. 4. Experience - their experience of a property begins the moment they've made a booking and continues right through to the end of their stay. 5. Evaluate - the guest evaluates their overall experience both during their stay and after they check out. That's why guest reviews are a good indicator of how guests rate the quality of and service at your property."",
