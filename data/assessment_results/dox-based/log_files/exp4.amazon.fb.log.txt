Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12.

It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12.

It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12.

Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",

A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how "main parameter used for ranking" is defined. The main parameters used for ranking in Amazon store search results are customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description). These factors are considered the main parameters because they provide the best indicators of what Amazon thinks customers will want to purchase (paragraph 0).

    "For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\"",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the main parameters used for determining ranking. For the "Best Seller" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon (paragraph 0). When listing search results in a specific order, factors such as customer actions, information about the item, availability, delivery speed, costs, and whether the item will be of interest are considered (paragraph 1). Badges are given based on a variety of factors including the number of sales, ratings, price, and availability (paragraph 2). For "Featured" results, customer actions and information about the item are the main factors (paragraph 3). Performance metrics such as Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate determine eligibility (paragraph 4). Order volume is also a factor (paragraph 6). For a Featured Offer, factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance are considered (paragraph 7).

<Answers> [
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\""

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains why certain parameters are considered as the main ones for determining ranking instead of others. Customer actions such as how frequently an item was purchased and information about the item such as title, price, and description are considered the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what Amazon thinks customers will want to purchase (paragraph 0). Other factors that Amazon considers when choosing featured results include availability, delivery speed, costs such as shipping costs, and whether Amazon thinks the item will be of interest, such as new items (paragraph 1). For the "Best Seller" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon (paragraph 2). When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases (paragraph 9).

Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",

    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately.",

    "The product detail page provides customers with easy access to information about a product and facilitates comparison of available offers. The Featured Offer attempts to predict the offer customers would choose if they compared all offers in detail and presents that offer on the product detail page. Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance. As a result, there may be more than one Featured Offer for a product, or none. The product detail page provides a simple starting point for customers to browse all available offers, and the vast majority of customers who compare these offers ultimately select a Featured Offer. See https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G37911?locale=en-GB for more information on the Featured Offer.",
    "Customers find, discover, and shop for products in the Amazon store in multiple ways. They can enter a specific query into the search box. They can browse selection by product department. They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads. Many customers also come to the Amazon store from other stores, advertising in other locations, and via general search.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads.",
    "We try to show customers products we think they will want to purchase, based on a customer's search, browsing or purchase history or other offers on the page. For example, we may present the product the customer is currently viewing or most recently placed in their shopping basket together with relevant complementary products (for instance, a printer and ink cartridge). We may show customers what products other Amazon customers viewed (or bought) after viewing (or buying) the product the customer is looking at. Similarly, we may feature a product which a customer viewed but did not purchase and display related products that other Amazon customers viewed.",
    "A key feature of the Amazon website is that the same product can be sold by several sellers.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The ranking mechanism takes into account customer actions such as how frequently an item was purchased, and information about the item such as title, price, and description (paragraph 1, 2). Other factors considered include availability, delivery speed, costs such as shipping costs, and whether the item is thought to be of interest, for example, new items (paragraph 3). The mechanism also considers factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance when identifying a Featured Offer (paragraph 5, 11). For badges, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon, and other factors like highly rated and well-priced products which are available to ship immediately are also considered (paragraph 4). For Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases (paragraph 7).

<Answers> [
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "The product detail page provides customers with easy access to information about a product and facilitates comparison of available offers. The Featured Offer attempts to predict the offer customers would choose if they compared all offers in detail and presents that offer on the product detail page. Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance. As a result, there may be more than one Featured Offer for a product, or none. The product detail page provides a simple starting point for customers to browse all available offers, and the vast majority of customers who compare these offers ultimately select a Featured Offer. See https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G37911?locale=en-GB for more information on the Featured Offer.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "Customers find, discover, and shop for products in the Amazon store in multiple ways. They can enter a specific query into the search box. They can browse selection by product department. They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads. Many customers also come to the Amazon store from other stores, advertising in other locations, and via general search.",
    "They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads.",
    "Here are some best practices for providing search terms: 1. Don't include product identifiers such as brand names, product names, compatible product names, ASINs, UPC codes, and so on. 2. Don't provide inaccurate, misleading, or irrelevant information such as the wrong product category, the wrong gender, out-of-context words, and so on. 3. Don't provide excessively long content. Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The ranking mechanism considers factors such as customer actions, information about the item (title, price, and description), availability, delivery speed, costs, and whether the item is of interest (paragraph 4). It also considers factors like price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance (paragraph 5). For badges, the ranking mechanism considers factors like the number of recent and historical sales of an item, whether the product is highly rated and well-priced, and whether it is available to ship immediately (paragraph 2). For Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases (paragraph 9).

    "Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought.",

    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "Customers find, discover, and shop for products in the Amazon store in multiple ways. They can enter a specific query into the search box. They can browse selection by product department. They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads. Many customers also come to the Amazon store from other stores, advertising in other locations, and via general search.",
    "The product detail page provides customers with easy access to information about a product and facilitates comparison of available offers. The Featured Offer attempts to predict the offer customers would choose if they compared all offers in detail and presents that offer on the product detail page. Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance. As a result, there may be more than one Featured Offer for a product, or none. The product detail page provides a simple starting point for customers to browse all available offers, and the vast majority of customers who compare these offers ultimately select a Featured Offer. See https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G37911?locale=en-GB for more information on the Featured Offer.",
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads.",
    "Here are some best practices for providing search terms: 1. Don't include product identifiers such as brand names, product names, compatible product names, ASINs, UPC codes, and so on. 2. Don't provide inaccurate, misleading, or irrelevant information such as the wrong product category, the wrong gender, out-of-context words, and so on. 3. Don't provide excessively long content. Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The ranking mechanism takes into account customer actions such as how frequently an item was purchased and information about the item such as title, price, and description (paragraph 0). Other factors considered include availability, delivery speed, costs such as shipping costs, and whether the item is thought to be of interest, for example, new items (paragraph 4). The ranking mechanism also considers seller performance and Prime eligibility (paragraph 14). Furthermore, badges are used to highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like, with factors considered for eligibility including the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon and a combination of factors for badges like "Amazon's Choice", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately (paragraph 2).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products.",
    "For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon.",
    "Here are some best practices for providing search terms: 1. Don't include product identifiers such as brand names, product names, compatible product names, ASINs, UPC codes, and so on. 2. Don't provide inaccurate, misleading, or irrelevant information such as the wrong product category, the wrong gender, out-of-context words, and so on. 3. Don't provide excessively long content. Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",
    "Customers find, discover, and shop for products in the Amazon store in multiple ways. They can enter a specific query into the search box. They can browse selection by product department. They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads. Many customers also come to the Amazon store from other stores, advertising in other locations, and via general search.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "Customers must be able to find your products before they can buy them. One way customers find your products is to search by entering the keywords, which are matched against information such as title and description that you provide for a product. By providing relevant and complete information for your product, you can increase your product's visibility and sales. Below are some general guidelines to improve your product discoverability."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The main factors considered are customer actions, such as how frequently an item was purchased, and information about the item, such as title, price, and description, as these provide the best indicators of what customers will want to purchase (paragraph 0, 2, 5, 8). Other factors considered include availability, delivery speed, costs such as shipping costs, and whether the item is thought to be of interest, such as new items (paragraph 5). The ranking mechanism also considers factors like price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance when identifying a Featured Offer (paragraph 7). For badges, a variety of factors are considered, including the number of recent and historical sales of an item for the "Best Seller" badge, and a combination of factors for "Amazon's Choice", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products that are available to ship immediately (paragraph 1, 10, 11, 15).

    "5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "If you are a Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) seller, your FBA new offers are automatically eligible to win the Buy Box. Otherwise, you must meet all of the conditions listed below. Amazon does not guarantee placement in the Buy Box. 1. Type of selling account: You must have a Professional selling account. 2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible. You can see how you are doing on the Account Health page. 3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories)."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism works and the main parameters used. The ranking mechanism sorts items based on several factors such as customer actions, information about the item, availability, delivery speed, costs, and whether the item is of interest (paragraph 1). The documentation also mentions that the ranking mechanism sorts items based on customer reviews, the day they were first available on Amazon, and price (paragraph 1). For the "Best Seller" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon (paragraph 2). Other factors considered for badges include product ratings, price, availability, and participation in a program (paragraph 3). Performance-based requirements are also a factor for sellers to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement (paragraph 4). Performance metrics such as Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate determine eligibility for the Buy Box (paragraph 5 and 7). Lastly, Amazon store search results are sorted by "Featured" by default, considering customer actions and information about the item as the main factors (paragraph 6).

<Answers> [
    "For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\"",
    "It will not improve your product placement in shopping results."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains what is most important in determining ranking. For the "Best Seller" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon (paragraph 0 and 1). For "Amazon's Choice", it indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately (paragraph 1). For search results, factors such as customer actions, information about the item, availability, delivery speed, costs, and whether the item will be of interest are considered (paragraph 2 and 3). For a seller to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement, they must meet performance-based requirements (paragraph 4). Factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance are considered when identifying a Featured Offer (paragraph 7).

<Question> Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase.",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance.",
    "Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "The product detail page provides customers with easy access to information about a product and facilitates comparison of available offers. The Featured Offer attempts to predict the offer customers would choose if they compared all offers in detail and presents that offer on the product detail page. Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance. As a result, there may be more than one Featured Offer for a product, or none. The product detail page provides a simple starting point for customers to browse all available offers, and the vast majority of customers who compare these offers ultimately select a Featured Offer. See https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G37911?locale=en-GB for more information on the Featured Offer.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges.",
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible.",
    "Here are some best practices for providing search terms: 1. Don't include product identifiers such as brand names, product names, compatible product names, ASINs, UPC codes, and so on. 2. Don't provide inaccurate, misleading, or irrelevant information such as the wrong product category, the wrong gender, out-of-context words, and so on. 3. Don't provide excessively long content. Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",
    "For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "Seller offerings for Music and DVD products are eligible for the Featured Offer if fulfilled through Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA)."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. Customer actions, such as how frequently an item was purchased, and information about the item, such as title, price, and description, are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what customers will want to purchase (paragraph 0). Other factors considered when choosing Featured results include price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance (paragraph 3). Factors for badges include the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon, and for "Amazon's Choice", highly rated and well-priced products that are available to ship immediately are considered (paragraph 6). For Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases (paragraph 8).

<Answers> [
    "Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",

    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",

    "The product detail page provides customers with easy access to information about a product and facilitates comparison of available offers. The Featured Offer attempts to predict the offer customers would choose if they compared all offers in detail and presents that offer on the product detail page. Amazon identifies a Featured Offer by considering factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance. As a result, there may be more than one Featured Offer for a product, or none. The product detail page provides a simple starting point for customers to browse all available offers, and the vast majority of customers who compare these offers ultimately select a Featured Offer. See https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G37911?locale=en-GB for more information on the Featured Offer.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The main factors considered for ranking include customer actions such as how frequently an item was purchased, and information about the item such as title, price, and description (paragraph 0). Other factors include availability, delivery speed, costs such as shipping costs, and whether the provider thinks the item will be of interest, such as new items (paragraph 1). For Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, the provider primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases (paragraph 2). The provider also considers factors including price, delivery speed, Prime eligibility, and seller performance when identifying a Featured Offer (paragraph 6). For badges, the provider considers a variety of factors including the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon, and a combination of factors for "Amazon's Choice", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately (paragraph 9).

<Answers> [
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products.",
    "To help increase your products' visibility in the store, you should price your products competitively, keep stock available for fast shipment, and provide complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about your products. Tips to improve your product listings can be found at https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/G10471?locale=en-GB.",
    "Customers must be able to find your products before they can buy them. One way customers find your products is to search by entering the keywords, which are matched against information such as title and description that you provide for a product. By providing relevant and complete information for your product, you can increase your product's visibility and sales. Below are some general guidelines to improve your product discoverability.",
    "Here are some best practices for providing search terms: 1. Don't include product identifiers such as brand names, product names, compatible product names, ASINs, UPC codes, and so on. 2. Don't provide inaccurate, misleading, or irrelevant information such as the wrong product category, the wrong gender, out-of-context words, and so on. 3. Don't provide excessively long content. Respect the limits that are set for different fields. 4. Don't provide redundant information that is already captured in other fields such as title, author, brand, and so on. It will not improve your product placement in shopping results. 5. When entering several words as a search term, put them in the most logical order. A customer is more likely to search for \"big stuffed teddy bears\" than for \"teddy stuffed bears.\" 6. Use a single space to separate keywords. No commas, semicolons or carets are required. 7. Don't include statements that are only temporarily true, such as, \"new,\" \"on sale,\" or \"available now.\" 8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries. 9. Don't include common misspellings of the product name. Our systems compensate for common customer misspellings and also offers corrective suggestions. 10. Don't provide variants of spacing, punctuation, capitalization, and pluralization (\"80GB\" and \"80 GB,\" \"computer\" and \"computers,\" and so on). Our systems automatically include different case forms, word forms, and spelling variants for searching. 11. Don't include terms that are abusive or offensive in nature. 12. Abbreviations, alternate names, topics, and key characters (for books, movies, and so on) could be included as search terms.",
    "Badges highlight certain product information to help customers find items they might like. We consider a variety of factors when choosing the products eligible for badges. For the \"Best Seller\" badge, the most important factor is the number of recent and historical sales of an item sold on Amazon. Others consider a combination of factors, like \"Amazon's Choice\", which indicates highly rated and well-priced products, which are available to ship immediately. We also use badges such as \"Lightning Deal\" and \"Deal of the Day\" to help customers find promotions in which a limited number of discounts are offered on an item for a short period of time, or which are only offered during a special event, like \"Black Friday\". Badges can also indicate participation in a program, such as \"Prime\" or provide information about an action a customer has taken on an item, such as whether the customer has already added the item to their shopping basket.",
    "You can use these options to list search results in a specific order: 1. Featured: shows featured items. We consider many factors when choosing featured results, such as: Customer actions, e.g., how often an item was bought. Information about the item, e.g., title, price, and description. Availability. Delivery speed. Costs, e.g., shipping costs. Whether we think the item will be of interest, e.g., new items. 2. Avg. Customer Review: sorts items based on Customer Reviews. This includes the average number of stars out of five and the number of reviews for each result. 3. Newest Arrivals: sorts items based on the day they were first available on Amazon. 4. Price High to Low: sorts items based on price. The highest price item is at the top and the lowest price item is at the bottom. 5. Price Low to High: sorts items based on price. The lowest price item is at the top and the highest price item is at the bottom.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "8. Don't include subjective claims such as amazing, good quality, and so on, since most customers don't use subjective terms in their queries.",
    "You can use the left navigation menu to refine the results in a department, based on specific criteria, e.g., \"Eligible for Free Shipping.\" Depending on the department, you'll see specific refinement options. Note: 1. We display all of the information we have about an item on its product detail page. 2. These pages often include Customer Reviews with useful information about product content and compatibility. 3. If you don't find the information you need on the product detail page, you can search the web to research the product or find the manufacturer's contact information.",
    "For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "Amazon provides you with an opportunity to add search terms for your products.",
    "They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads.",
    "We try to show customers products we think they will want to purchase, based on a customer's search, browsing or purchase history or other offers on the page. For example, we may present the product the customer is currently viewing or most recently placed in their shopping basket together with relevant complementary products (for instance, a printer and ink cartridge). We may show customers what products other Amazon customers viewed (or bought) after viewing (or buying) the product the customer is looking at. Similarly, we may feature a product which a customer viewed but did not purchase and display related products that other Amazon customers viewed.",
    "For example, customers frequently engage with Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, which feature offers available to buy in the Amazon store.",
    "The Buy Box is the display on a product detail page with the Add to basket button that customers can use to add items to their shopping carts. When one of your listed items appears as the default on the product page, you \"win\" the Buy Box, increasing your chances of selling that item. Note: Becoming eligible to win the Buy Box doesn't guarantee that you will win it; that said, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances. The \"Buy Used Box\" is not available in many categories, and availability is subject to change at the category's discretion. To learn more, see Winning the Buy Box.",
    "Customers can find and discover offers through the ads you buy, and we label those clearly as ads. For example, customers frequently engage with Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, which feature offers available to buy in the Amazon store. These ads appear at the top of, alongside, or within shopping results and on product detail pages. When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases. Some offers are ineligible for display as Sponsored Brands or Sponsored Products, and you must also meet eligibility criteria to buy these ads. For more on eligibility, see https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/GS529693F2TCM93T?locale=en-GB.",
    "3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).",
    "Customers find, discover, and shop for products in the Amazon store in multiple ways. They can enter a specific query into the search box. They can browse selection by product department. They can discover products grouped by common attributes or through ads. Many customers also come to the Amazon store from other stores, advertising in other locations, and via general search.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services. Users can increase their products' visibility by pricing their products competitively, keeping stock available for fast shipment, and providing complete, relevant, accurate, and up-to-date information about their products (paragraph 0 and 1). They can also improve product discoverability by providing relevant and complete information for their product, and by following best practices for providing search terms (paragraph 2 and 3). Badges can also be used to highlight certain product information and help customers find items they might like (paragraph 4). Users can also increase their chances of selling an item by winning the "Buy Box" (paragraph 15). Additionally, users can improve the ranking of their goods or services by buying ads, such as Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, which appear at the top of, alongside, or within shopping results and on product detail pages (paragraph 16).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct or indirect payments to the provider, and what effect this has?
<Answers> [
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "When one of your listed items appears as the default on the product page, you \"win\" the Buy Box, increasing your chances of selling that item.",
    "Customers can find and discover offers through the ads you buy, and we label those clearly as ads. For example, customers frequently engage with Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, which feature offers available to buy in the Amazon store. These ads appear at the top of, alongside, or within shopping results and on product detail pages. When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases. Some offers are ineligible for display as Sponsored Brands or Sponsored Products, and you must also meet eligibility criteria to buy these ads. For more on eligibility, see https://sellercentral.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/external/GS529693F2TCM93T?locale=en-GB.",
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "We try to show customers products we think they will want to purchase, based on a customer's search, browsing or purchase history or other offers on the page. For example, we may present the product the customer is currently viewing or most recently placed in their shopping basket together with relevant complementary products (for instance, a printer and ink cartridge). We may show customers what products other Amazon customers viewed (or bought) after viewing (or buying) the product the customer is looking at. Similarly, we may feature a product which a customer viewed but did not purchase and display related products that other Amazon customers viewed.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct payments to the provider. This can be done by bidding on keywords for Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products. The amount bid, along with the expected customer interest in the offer, influences the placement of the product or service. This can lead to increased visibility and potentially increased sales (Paragraph 0, 1, 3, 4). However, the documentation does not provide information on the effect of indirect payments to the provider.

<Question> Does the documentation explain what the business logic behind allowing users to affect the ranking of their products or services through payments is, and what the potential consequences of this are?
<Answers> [
    "To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.",
    "When choosing Sponsored Brands and Sponsored Products, Amazon primarily considers the keywords you bid on, how much you bid, and customers' expected interest in your offers, based on information about your offer, similarities between your and other offers, and past customer purchases.",
    "Amazon store search results are sorted by \"Featured\" by default. We consider a variety of factors when choosing Featured results. Customer actions (such as how frequently an item was purchased) and information about the item (such as title, price, and description) are the main factors because they provide the best indicators of what we think customers will want to purchase. For other factors we may consider when choosing Featured results, see https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=help_search_1-1?ie=UTF8&nodeId=201889520&qid=1587397208&sr=1-1.",
    "We may show customers what products other Amazon customers viewed (or bought) after viewing (or buying) the product the customer is looking at.",
    "By providing relevant and complete information for your product, you can increase your product's visibility and sales.",
    "To guard against abuse or otherwise to preserve the customer experience, we may remove a seller's eligibility for the Featured Offer or not display a Featured Offer at all.",
    "When a seller becomes the Featured Offer on an offer's product detail page, that seller's specific information (respective offer price and seller name) will be displayed on the product detail page. Note: Seller offerings for Music and DVD products are eligible for the Featured Offer if fulfilled through Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA). Video (VHS) listings are not eligible to appear as the Featured Offer on the product detail page.",
