When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",

These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites.

These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites.

            "sentence": "Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to any and all attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking on our site. These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Sub-ratings do not factor into the ranking calculation.",
    "\"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites.",
    "While it's helpful to be able show users whether you have availability for their search dates and help them book, or provide a website link or phone number, these have never been part of the Popularity Ranking algorithm.",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "Ratings selected may have an impact on the property's position in Tripadvisor's popularity rankings and/or how a property appears on our platform.",
    "Search: Tripadvisor's internal search function presents results relevant to your text query. To give you the most useful information, search algorithms look at many factors and signals, including the words of your query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and your location. Different result types can have different factors relevant to them, but the text query is applied to rank all the results on the search page. Apart from the query, the following factors are used to order the search results, depending on the type of Tripadvisor content discovered by the search: 1. Followers/followees count, verified member flag - for Member Profiles. 2. Reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, distance from you, open/closed state - for Hotels, Restaurants, Things to Do, Vacation Rental properties. 3. Number of page views - for Geographic Locations. 4. Date (freshness of the content) - for Forum Posts.",
    "Different result types can have different factors relevant to them, but the text query is applied to rank all the results on the search page.",
    "2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "The ranking is re-calculated daily based on all published reviews, including those new reviews received that day. Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how "main parameter used for ranking" is defined. The main parameter used for ranking is referred to as the 'Popularity Index' which is based on the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0). The Popularity Ranking is also based on the consistency of those reviews over time (paragraph 7). For vacation rental property listings, the ranking is based on the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through their sites (paragraph 2 and 6). For search results, factors such as the words of the query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and the user's location are considered (paragraph 9).

<Question> Does the documentation provide the main parameters used for determining ranking?
<Answers> [
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "While it's helpful to be able show users whether you have availability for their search dates and help them book, or provide a website link or phone number, these have never been part of the Popularity Ranking algorithm.",
    "Ratings selected may have an impact on the property's position in Tripadvisor's popularity rankings and/or how a property appears on our platform.",
    "Search: Tripadvisor's internal search function presents results relevant to your text query. To give you the most useful information, search algorithms look at many factors and signals, including the words of your query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and your location. Different result types can have different factors relevant to them, but the text query is applied to rank all the results on the search page. Apart from the query, the following factors are used to order the search results, depending on the type of Tripadvisor content discovered by the search: 1. Followers/followees count, verified member flag - for Member Profiles. 2. Reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, distance from you, open/closed state - for Hotels, Restaurants, Things to Do, Vacation Rental properties. 3. Number of page views - for Geographic Locations. 4. Date (freshness of the content) - for Forum Posts.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "Sub-ratings do not factor into the ranking calculation.",
    "Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the main parameters used for determining ranking. For flights, the parameters include price, duration, best value, and various aspects of available flight times (paragraph 0). For hotels and restaurants, the parameters include traveler ranking or highest rating, best value, price (low to high), distance to city centre, and featured (paragraph 1). The Popularity Index, which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users, is also used for ranking (paragraph 2). For places of interest and/or tour operators, parameters include traveller favourites, traveller ranking, book online, price, and duration (paragraph 8). For vacation rental properties, parameters include Tripadvisor Sort, price (low to high/high to low), bedrooms (most to least/least to most), and number of reviews (paragraph 11). The search function also uses factors such as the words of the query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and location (paragraph 14).

<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking?",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites.

    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",

    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",

    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",

Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31.

    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "\"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The ranking mechanism takes into account various factors such as the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19). It also considers the prices offered by the establishments (paragraph 0, 8, 13, 14, 16), the distance to the city centre (paragraph 0), and the number of bedrooms in the case of vacation rental properties (paragraph 6). The ranking mechanism also takes into account the revenue made by Tripadvisor on bookings, the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the duration of tours, activities, and experiences (paragraph 3, 9, 11). Furthermore, the ranking mechanism considers the business's performance in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area (paragraph 10, 12).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",

    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",

    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews.",
    "The results displayed are not exhaustive of all the offers available on the Internet. Tripadvisor LLC displays results from data provided by its partners and is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by these third-party providers and that it displays on its sites or applications, or content on other websites. The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The ranking mechanism takes into account various factors such as the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0, 2, 5, 11, 15, 16, 17). It also considers the prices offered by the establishments (paragraph 0, 9, 10, 13, 18), the location of the establishments (paragraph 0), and the availability of the establishments (paragraph 0). The ranking mechanism also considers the duration of tours, activities, and experiences (paragraph 6, 13), the number of bedrooms in properties (paragraph 10), and the number of times a listing has been viewed (paragraph 10). The ranking mechanism also takes into account the revenue made by Tripadvisor on bookings (paragraph 6, 10, 19), the number of page views by Tripadvisor users (paragraph 6, 19), and the performance of a business in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area (paragraph 7, 8, 14).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking?",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31. Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The ranking mechanism, known as the "Popularity Ranking", is based on the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users (Paragraph 1). The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business (Paragraph 2). The ranking also takes into account a business's performance in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area (Paragraph 3). The ranking mechanism also considers factors such as confirmed availability from partners, booking popularity, traveler ratings, prices, location, and personal user preferences (Paragraph 0).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking?",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31. Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking.",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. The ranking is based on the 'Popularity Index', which takes into account the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0). The Popularity Ranking also considers a business's performance in relation to other businesses in the area (paragraph 1). The ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business, and as more reviews are accumulated over time, the algorithm gains more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect (paragraph 5). The quality and quantity of reviews over time provide a view of each business's consistency, and a business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews (paragraph 7). The ranking also takes into account the overall quality of the reviews a business receives over time (paragraph 10).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment (if any)?
<Answers> [
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",
    "Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Tripadvisor does not accept any compensation that could influence the rankings of flight for a given user search, as described above.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Although Sponsored Placements may appear in and around a list of results, partners cannot buy their way to a particular place in any of the ranking methods described above.",
    "The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to any and all attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking on our site. These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation does explain the possibilities to influence ranking against direct or indirect payment. Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods (paragraph 0 and 16). The ranking of price offers for hotels may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in Tripadvisor's "cost-per-click" auction system (paragraph 1 and 5). The ranking of accommodations takes into account the compensation paid to Tripadvisor by those accommodations and/or booking sites (paragraph 3). Sponsored placements, which are indicated by the label "Ad" or "Sponsored", may appear in and around a list of results, but partners cannot buy their way to a particular place in any of the ranking methods (paragraph 4 and 7). Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement (paragraph 12 and 14). However, Tripadvisor does not accept any compensation that could influence the rankings of flights for a given user search (paragraph 2).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the effects of payments, on ranking (if any)?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Tripadvisor does not accept any compensation that could influence the rankings of flight for a given user search, as described above.",
    "Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",
    "A business's commercial relationship with Tripadvisor has absolutely no impact on the Popularity Ranking.",
    "Does having a commercial relationship with Tripadvisor impact my Popularity Ranking?",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "The results displayed are not exhaustive of all the offers available on the Internet. Tripadvisor LLC displays results from data provided by its partners and is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of the information provided by these third-party providers and that it displays on its sites or applications, or content on other websites. The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to any and all attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking on our site. These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",
    "5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites.",
    "Payment Protection gives guests extra peace of mind when booking a rental through our website.",
    "Every fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business's rank in our Traveler Ranking - whether the review was ever posted or not.",
    "How do fraud penalties impact the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Sub-ratings do not factor into the ranking calculation. However, they do provide users with valuable information on your business. How do fraud penalties impact the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Fraud penalties exist on Tripadvisor to protect the integrity of the content on the site. We employ a number of penalization methods for companies that try to manipulate our system which may impact a business's position in the Popularity Rankings, and ultimately could lead to the publication of a red alert warning to users.",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "You are covered up to $10,000, PS7,000 or EUR7000 paid via our payment platform (this depends on the currency in which you made the booking).",
    "Pages featuring Hotels may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue paid to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Popular Nearby\": Proximity to the hotel featured at the top of the page, availability with our partners, user reviews 2. \"Similar Sponsored Properties\": Payments to Tripadvisor from the properties listed, along with user review scores, location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners 3. \"Most booked properties\": User review scores, location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners 4. \"Compare more popular hotels\": Location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners and reviews 5. \"Nearby\": Location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners and reviews 6. \"Vacation Rentals\": Vacation rental properties advertised on the Tripadvisor website ranked by review data, price and availability for the user's selected dates."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation does explain the effects of payments on ranking. The ranking of establishments can be influenced by the compensation paid to Tripadvisor by those establishments and/or booking sites (paragraph 0, 11). The ranking of price offers for a particular property can depend in part on the price paid by advertising partners participating in Tripadvisor's "cost-per-click" auction system (paragraph 2, 4, 9). Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may also influence certain ranking methods (paragraph 5). However, a business's commercial relationship with Tripadvisor has no impact on the Popularity Ranking (paragraph 6). Furthermore, revenue paid to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also influence the selection of other points of interest, suppliers or their products featured on pages with hotels (paragraph 19).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism works and, in particular, what the main parameters used are?
<Answers> [
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "The ranking is re-calculated daily based on all published reviews, including those new reviews received that day. Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "While it's helpful to be able show users whether you have availability for their search dates and help them book, or provide a website link or phone number, these have never been part of the Popularity Ranking algorithm.",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "\"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites.",
    "The ranking is re-calculated daily based on all published reviews, including those new reviews received that day.",
    "For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes.",
    "Ratings selected may have an impact on the property's position in Tripadvisor's popularity rankings and/or how a property appears on our platform.",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "Search: Tripadvisor's internal search function presents results relevant to your text query. To give you the most useful information, search algorithms look at many factors and signals, including the words of your query, reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and your location. Different result types can have different factors relevant to them, but the text query is applied to rank all the results on the search page. Apart from the query, the following factors are used to order the search results, depending on the type of Tripadvisor content discovered by the search: 1. Followers/followees count, verified member flag - for Member Profiles. 2. Reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, distance from you, open/closed state - for Hotels, Restaurants, Things to Do, Vacation Rental properties. 3. Number of page views - for Geographic Locations. 4. Date (freshness of the content) - for Forum Posts."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism works and the main parameters used. The ranking is based on the 'Popularity Index', which takes into account the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0). The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business (paragraph 3). The ranking is recalculated daily based on all published reviews, including new reviews received that day (paragraph 15). The Popularity Ranking also takes into account a business's performance in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area (paragraph 6). For hotels and restaurants, other factors such as confirmed availability, booking popularity, prices, location, and personal user preferences are also considered (paragraph 2). For flights, the ranking is based on price, flight duration, and other factors such as additional fees (paragraph 7). For vacation rental properties, the ranking is based on the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through their sites (paragraph 11). For search results, factors such as reviews, bubble rating, number of page views, and distance from the user are considered (paragraph 19).

    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "\"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites.",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors.",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "While it's helpful to be able show users whether you have availability for their search dates and help them book, or provide a website link or phone number, these have never been part of the Popularity Ranking algorithm.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "All other things being equal, a business with more 5-bubble ratings will rank higher than a business with lower bubble ratings.",
    "2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the most important factors in determining ranking are the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews a business receives from users, as well as the consistency of those reviews over time (paragraph 5). The Popularity Ranking also takes into account a business's performance in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area (paragraph 1, 2). It is also noted that a business with more 5-bubble ratings will rank higher than a business with lower bubble ratings, all other things being equal (paragraph 15). However, just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors (paragraph 11). Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may also influence certain ranking methods (paragraph 18).

<Question> Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31. Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "Pages featuring Hotels may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue paid to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Popular Nearby\": Proximity to the hotel featured at the top of the page, availability with our partners, user reviews 2. \"Similar Sponsored Properties\": Payments to Tripadvisor from the properties listed, along with user review scores, location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners 3. \"Most booked properties\": User review scores, location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners 4. \"Compare more popular hotels\": Location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners and reviews 5. \"Nearby\": Location, availability, price data, booking popularity with our partners and reviews 6. \"Vacation Rentals\": Vacation rental properties advertised on the Tripadvisor website ranked by review data, price and availability for the user's selected dates.",
    "3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking?",
    "2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched.",
    "When we talk about review quantity, it's important to note that a business just needs to have enough reviews to provide statistical significance and allow for a confident comparison to other businesses. Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors. For example, a business with 1,000 reviews isn't necessarily going to be rated higher than one with 500 reviews that were received in roughly the same period of time. This is because they both have enough reviews to make us confident in the potential travel experience they can deliver.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "In most cases, this is because A has a statistically better set of reviews (based on quality, quantity, and recency) than B. I received a bad review.",
    "They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted.",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this.",
    "A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews."
]
<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. For hotels and restaurants, the ranking is based on the 'Popularity Index', which is determined by the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0). For flights, the ranking is based on price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees (paragraph 2). For vacation rental properties, the ranking is based on the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through their sites (paragraph 12). Other factors that inform the ranking of goods or services include revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group, user browsing history, availability and pricing data, and bookings, among others (paragraph 1, 3).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "\"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners.",
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "Flights are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Price\": ranks the results according to the prices currently offered by our partners. 2. \"Duration\": ranks based on total estimated flight time from departure to arrival. 3. \"Best Value\": ranks the best combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes factors such as additional fees. 4. \"Earliest/Latest Outbound/Return Arrival/Departure\": these options list by various aspects of available flight times.",
    "Pages featuring Things to Do may also feature horizontal selections of other points of interest, suppliers or their products. A range of different factors inform these selections, and the title is usually indicative of this. Revenue to companies in the Tripadvisor group can also be a factor. The ingredients that feed these selections are summarised below. Those selections that are influenced by revenue are highlighted. 1. \"Top attractions\": Attractions ranking influenced by revenue, ratings, review count. Products selected for each Attraction are influenced by product bookings, reviews and ratings and evaluated by the Tripadvisor team 2. \"Browse by category\" / \"Popular things to do\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 3. \"Ways to tour\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 4. \"Recommended for you\": User browsing history (previously viewed products and points of interest) 5. \"Category-based selections \": Same as Traveller Favourites sort, described above 6. \"Experiences you don't want to miss\": Traveller Favourites sort, but filtered further using availability and pricing data 7. \"Recommended experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 8. \"Similar experiences\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked POIs 9. \"Recommended\": Revenue, bookings, pageviews, POI name, Product name, review counts, ratings, Product/POI mappings 10. \"Top ways to experience\": Ratings, review count, bookings, geographic distance, Revenue, relevant point of interest data, title, description 11. \"Ways to experience\": Revenue, ratings, review count 12. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks 13. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, geo location, price, review count, ratings, duration, POI mappings 14. \"Similar experiences\": Availability, bookings, page views 15. \"You may also like\": Bookings, ratings, review count, category, linked points of interest 16. \"Travelers also viewed\": Page views 17. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, point of interest data 18. \"Recently viewed\": User behavior (recent views) 19. \"Top attractions in [location]\": Revenue, ratings, review count 20. \"Buy it with\": Bookings, category, location, price, review count, ratings, duration, relevant points of interest 21. \"Attraction tickets\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 22. \"Half day tours\": Revenue, ratings, review count, location 23. \"Shop tickets and tours\": Bookings, page views, ratings, clicks, location 24. \"City tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 25. \"Cultural tours\": Revenue, ratings, numbers of reviews, location 26. \"[Location] is great for\" cluster shelves: Attraction bookings, page views, reviews, place of interest data, user's answers to tagging questions 27. \"Essential [Location]\" - Do: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 28. \"Essential [Location]\" - Stay: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 29. \"Essential [Location]\" - Eat: Hand curated by Tripadvisor staff 30. \"Recommended [Attraction Type] Experiences\": Traveller Favourites sort (see above) and further curation by Tripadvisor staff 31. Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "The bubble ratings that users provide as part of their reviews are used to rank the quality of the experience at each business.",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Vacation rental properties are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites. For all other sort orders with the exception of Traveler Rating, the Tripadvisor Sort also works as a \"tie-breaker\" to determine ordering where there are two or more properties with the same attributes. 2. \"Price (Low to high/ High to low)\": ranks properties based on priceon the dates searched. 3. \"Bedrooms (Most to least/ Least to most)\": ranks properties based on the number of bedrooms, in the order selected. 4. \"# of reviews\": ranks properties based on the number of reviews of the property.",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews.",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking.",
    "\"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews.",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "\"Tripadvisor Sort\" is the default sort order, and ranks vacation rental property listings based on (in order of importance from least to most) the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through our sites.",
    "The bubble ratings that users provide as part of their reviews are used to rank the quality of the experience at each business. All other things being equal, a business with more 5-bubble ratings will rank higher than a business with lower bubble ratings. Recency"

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The ranking of hotels and restaurants is based on the 'Popularity Index', which considers the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users (paragraph 0). The 'Best Value' ranking uses exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from partners, booking popularity, traveler ratings, prices, location, and personal user preferences (paragraph 0). The 'Price' ranking is based on the lowest prices offered through partners for selected dates at the time of search (paragraph 1). The 'Distance to city centre' ranking prioritizes establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for selected dates from partners (paragraph 0). The 'Featured' ranking takes into account the compensation paid to Tripadvisor by accommodations and/or booking sites, as well as exclusive Tripadvisor data (paragraph 0). The ranking of flights considers price, duration, and 'Best Value', which is a combination of price, flight duration, and sometimes additional fees (paragraph 5). The ranking of vacation rental properties is based on the property's overall traveler rating, number of times the listing has been viewed, and the revenue made by Tripadvisor companies from bookings made through their sites (paragraph 9). The ranking of 'Things to Do' is based on revenue made by Tripadvisor on bookings, the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews (paragraph 12). The 'Popularity Ranking' is based on the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews a business receives from users, and the consistency of those reviews over time (paragraph 10). The provider also uses unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within the Traveler Ranking (paragraph 2).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "Because the Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews -- that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations -- is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time.",
    "Over time, we continue to optimize and enhance the Popularity Ranking to improve our site experience for users and businesses alike. We know how important ranking on Tripadvisor is to businesses. Any changes we make are not undertaken lightly. They are carefully designed and tested to improve our rankings algorithm in very specific ways, while maintaining the accurate standings of existing businesses on Tripadvisor.",
    "Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area.",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Recent changes, in 2016 and 2018, have focused on promoting more consistency in the rankings. The goal with each change has been to more accurately reflect a business's performance relative to others in its location over time, regardless of its size or the rate at which it collects reviews. How can you improve your business's Popularity Ranking",
    "Positions in the ranking are not necessarily influenced by a single review -- positive or negative. Businesses may notice changes in their positions depending on their own performance, or based on how other businesses around them perform. Since our algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews you receive over time, regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve your business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area. Do Management Responses factor into the Popularity Ranking?",
    "The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users -- and the consistency of those reviews over time. Quality",
    "Just having more reviews doesn't mean that a business will be ranked higher than its competitors.",
    "Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users.",
    "The Popularity Ranking algorithm is designed to provide a statistical measure of confidence about the current experience at a business. As we accumulate more reviews on a business over time, we have more insight into the potential experience consumers can expect. Once we've reached a critical mass of reviews, we're able to more accurately predict that business's ranking.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "These factors interact over time to determine a business's Popularity Ranking. For example, the quality and quantity of reviews over time provide us with a view of each business's consistency. A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews. Similarly, recency and quantity are closely linked -- a large number of recent reviews will be valued higher than ones that are several years old. How has the Popularity Ranking evolved?",
    "As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it.",
    "Although Sponsored Placements may appear in and around a list of results, partners cannot buy their way to a particular place in any of the ranking methods described above. The advertising nature of these placements referenced for a fee is indicated by the label \"Ad\" or \"Sponsored\".",
    "Things to Do are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveller Favourites\": Tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, ranked according to revenue made by Tripadvisor on those bookings, plus the number of page views by Tripadvisor users, and the quantity and quality of reviews. 2. \"Traveller Ranking\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, based on traveller reviews in accordance with the Popularity Index, using the same method as stated above. 3. \"Book Online\": ranks places of interest and/or tour operators on Tripadvisor, promoting those where there is at least one tour or activity available to book on Tripadvisor. 4. \"Price\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on the prices offered by our partners. 5. \"Duration\": ranks tours, activities and experiences bookable on Tripadvisor, based on their duration.",
    "A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews.",
    "Attempts to Manipulate Property Ranking by Businesses",
    "Do the sub-ratings (cleanliness, service, etc.) impact my ranking?",
    "Sub-ratings do not factor into the ranking calculation. However, they do provide users with valuable information on your business. How do fraud penalties impact the Popularity Ranking?",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services. The Popularity Ranking is based on user feedback, so consistently collecting new, high-quality reviews that reflect levels of service and value that meet expectations is the best way for businesses to improve their position over time (paragraph 0). The algorithm takes into account the overall quality of the reviews received over time, so regularly collecting feedback from users is the best way to maintain or improve a business's position over time, relative to the performance of other businesses in the area (paragraph 2). The Popularity Ranking is based on the quality, recency, and quantity of reviews that a business receives from users, and the consistency of those reviews over time (paragraph 6). A business that has consistently good reviews will rank higher than one with a similar number of good and poor reviews (paragraph 15).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct or indirect payments to the provider, and what effect this has?
<Answers> [
    "Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above.",
    "Partners can enter into a number of different kinds of direct commercial relationship with Tripadvisor if they wish, especially in order to be bookable online. Commercial relationships that partners may have with Tripadvisor may influence certain ranking methods as described above. However, they have no influence on Tripadvisor's 'Popularity Index'.",
    "Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it.",
    "Sub-ratings do not factor into the ranking calculation. However, they do provide users with valuable information on your business. How do fraud penalties impact the Popularity Ranking?",
    "Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to any and all attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking on our site. These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",
    "Does having a commercial relationship with Tripadvisor impact my Popularity Ranking?",
    "It is important to note that the Popularity Ranking takes into account a business's performance, in relation to the performance of other businesses in the area. As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it. Movements in the Popularity Ranking may be a result of reviews on one particular business -- or reviews that have come in for other businesses in the area.",
    "Where price offers are provided for hotels, the ranking of price offers may depend in part on the price paid by affiliates who participate in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",

    "Fraud penalties exist on Tripadvisor to protect the integrity of the content on the site. We employ a number of penalization methods for companies that try to manipulate our system which may impact a business's position in the Popularity Rankings, and ultimately could lead to the publication of a red alert warning to users.",
    "If they wish to make a tour, activity or experience bookable through Tripadvisor or its affiliate companies, they must enter into an agreement with one of Tripadvisor's affiliate companies, pursuant to which the suppliers are paid for bookings made through our platforms.",
    "A business's commercial relationship with Tripadvisor has absolutely no impact on the Popularity Ranking.",
    "The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by our advertising partners participating in our \"cost-per-click\" auction system.",
    "What are our policy and criteria for ranking? Hotels and restaurants are currently ranked in the following ways: 1. \"Traveler Ranking\" or \"Highest Rating\": ranks the top rated hotels or restaurants, as the case may be, based on user input on Tripadvisor. Results are ranked on the basis of the 'Popularity Index' , which is based on the quality, recency and quantity of reviews an establishment receives from users. When restaurants are filtered by sub-category (for instance : type of cuisine, dinner, local cuisine, etc), then within this sub-category they are ranked according to the 'Popularity Index'. This is the same for the subcategory of bookable table and/or for which a special offer is applied. 2. \"Best Value\" is the default sort order for hotels and ranks these establishments using exclusive Tripadvisor data, including confirmed availability from our partners, booking popularity as reported to us by our partners, traveler ratings, prices, location and personal user preferences. 3. \"Price (low to high)\": ranks the establishments according to the lowest prices offered through our partners for your selected dates at the time of your search. 4. \"Distance to city centre\": ranks first the establishments closest to the applicable city centre with confirmed availability for your dates from our partners. 5. \"Featured\": ranks accommodations taking into account the compensation paid to us by those accommodations and/or booking sites. It also incorporates exclusive Tripadvisor data, including traveler ratings, confirmed availability from our partners, prices, booking popularity, location and personal user preferences.",
    "We have unique processes for moderating the reviews and content submitted to Tripadvisor, as well as proprietary algorithms that calculate a business' daily rank within our Traveler Ranking. Those processes and algorithms are applied in the same way to all content, complaints and properties. We never have and will never give our advertisers or anyone else preferential treatment when we moderate reviews.",
    "Tripadvisor does not accept any compensation that could influence the rankings of flight for a given user search, as described above.",
    "Every fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business's rank in our Traveler Ranking - whether the review was ever posted or not.",
    "Some vacation rental property owners/managers advertise through Tripadvisor's affiliate companies on a fixed cost subscription basis, and others pay for leads generated through their Tripadvisor listings. Some listings may appear on Tripadvisor as a result of licensing agreements with third party businesses who may charge us a fee for referring interested users to their websites to make bookings. The majority of advertisers, however, list their properties for free, and pay a commission when bookings are facilitated by the online platforms offered by the vacation rentals companies in our corporate group."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct or indirect payments to the provider. Partners can enter into different kinds of direct commercial relationships with Tripadvisor, especially to be bookable online, which may influence certain ranking methods (paragraph 1). Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement (paragraph 2). The ranking of price offers for a particular property will depend in part on the price paid by advertising partners participating in Tripadvisor's "cost-per-click" auction system (paragraph 14). However, it is important to note that these commercial relationships have no influence on Tripadvisor's 'Popularity Index' (paragraph 1) and partners cannot buy their way to a particular place in any of the ranking methods (paragraph 9). As one business moves up in the ranking, it impacts others directly around it (paragraph 3). Any attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking, such as submitting fraudulent reviews or offering incentives for reviews, are met with penalties which may impact a business's position in the Popularity Rankings (paragraph 5).

<Question> Does the documentation explain what the business logic behind allowing users to affect the ranking of their products or services through payments is, and what the potential consequences of this are?
<Answers> [
    "Operators whose products or experiences appear as sponsored may pay Tripadvisor or Viator more for the placement",
    "Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to any and all attempts at artificially manipulating a property's ranking on our site. These include, but are not limited to, the following actions: 1. Reviews submitted by property representatives. We reserve the right to remove content and/or penalize properties should we receive content submissions from anyone who owns, is employed by, or is affiliated with the reviewed property, or any umbrella or parent companies with which that property may be affiliated, in any way. This includes (but is not limited to) content from users who are upfront about their affiliation in addition to users who are impersonating travelers, competitors, or any other individuals or entities. It is also prohibited for representatives of a business to submit reviews on behalf of guests, regardless of whether the opinion is genuine or not. 2. Paid Reviews/Review Exchanges. Tripadvisor is staunchly opposed to the selling, purchasing, or quid-pro-quo exchange of reviews. Any reviews submitted in this manner are considered inherently fraudulent and will be met with penalties for not only the property or properties involved, but the reviewers as well. If you have been contacted by anyone offering these services, or you know of anyone involved in this behavior, please let our team know at contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 3. Incentives for Reviews. It is against our guidelines to offer or promise anything in exchange for any reviews, irrespective of rating. Examples include offers for free drinks, discounts, entry into a contest, making donations to a cause in the name of a customer, etc. 4. Incentives for Review Removals. attempts by an individual representing a property to offer anything in exchange for the removal of a published review are against our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 5. Pressuring Users to Remove Reviews. attempts by anyone affiliated with a property to pressure, threaten, or otherwise coerce a user into removing their review for that property are a violation of our guidelines and will be met with penalties. 6. Employee Incentives. It is a violation of our guidelines for a property to offer incentives designed to reward employees for encouraging reviews, e.g., a bonus for being mentioned in a review, or a contest for the highest number of reviews achieved within a certain timeframe. Such programs are against our guidelines and may be met with penalties to a property's ranking. If you are aware of such programs at any property, please let our team know by emailing contentintegrity@tripadvisor.com 7. Review Gating. We prohibit the practice of selectively soliciting positive content and/or rejecting moderate or negative content. If any survey or external website ultimately directs users to submit a review on Tripadvisor, the user interface and experience for submitting positive and negative reviews must be identical. For example, directing a guest to one review page if they indicate a positive experience but directing them to another path (such as an internal customer support channel) if they indicate a negative experience is against our review guidelines. 8. Restrictions. We do not allow properties to contractually prohibit or discourage guests from posting negative or critical reviews of their experience. Any properties found to be engaging in these practices will have a warning badge posted on their business listing page on Tripadvisor until that policy has been discontinued. 9. Vandalism. Any attempts, made by individuals affiliated with one property, to damage the reputation of a competing property are considered to be violations of our guidelines. This includes (but is not limited to) submitting negative reviews, attempting to falsely register as an owner of the competing listing, or similar behaviors.",

Every fraudulent submission we identify has a negative impact on a business's rank in our Traveler Ranking - whether the review was ever posted or not. 3. We may disqualify offending properties from our recognition and awards programs, such as our Travelers' Choice Awards. 4. We aggressively pursue companies or individuals that offer to boost a business' reputation by writing fake reviews on its behalf. When we catch them, we block or remove all of the fake reviews they've submitted, we penalize their clients, and in some cases we even help prosecutors send them to jail. 5. For businesses that repeatedly try to break the rules, we will post a warning notice on their Tripadvisor listing called a red penalty badge to warn travelers that they are not playing by the rules. We do not remove the listings of businesses that break the rules - because often that's exactly what unscrupulous business owners want.
