Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6.

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused, resulting in penalties by search engines. These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative, or misleading behaviors. Sites that engage in abuse, such as the practices outlined below, are considered low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action is taken against your site, you can contact our support team through the Bing Webmaster Tools.

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

            "sentence": "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

<Question> Does the documentation explain how "ranking" is defined/define "ranking"?
<Answers> [
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "These are sorted by relevance to the root keyword by default.",
    "The research also provides the Global breakdown of the search volume; it gives a clear picture of the countries where more users are searching for that keyword.",
    "Stuffing your content with specific keywords with the sole intent of artificially inflating the probability of ranking for particular search terms is in violation of our guidelines.",
    "By default, the tool also lists a set of keywords that are bringing traffic to websites and the corresponding search volume trend.",
    "It segregates keywords to show the ones which have become relevant recently and lists the questions that these keywords have appeared in if any.",
    "Bing's Keyword Research tool also gives a list of the top 10 URLs appearing in the search results for the root keyword and their associated topics. Topics are determined by Bing's content processing logic and denote the area that Bing considers relevant. Since these results also appear for the root keyword, the associated topic can act as a new root keyword to get more ideas in case users want to broaden their scope.",
    "The keyword research tool takes a root keyword as input to suggest matching and other relevant keywords. The tool has a search box on top where you can input the root keyword that you want to research. By default, the tool also lists a set of keywords that are bringing traffic to websites and the corresponding search volume trend. Clicking on any of these keywords will trigger a search, with that keyword as the root keyword. Keyword Research suggestions"

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how "ranking" is defined. In the context of ad placement, ranking is determined by multiple factors including the amount bid for a keyword, the ad's relevance, and the ad's performance based on various response signals such as click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 0). In the context of Bing search results, ranking is determined by complex algorithms that use machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. The main parameters used to rank pages in search results include relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time (paragraph 1).

<Answers> [
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "These parameters are listed in general order of importance.",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",

    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",

    "The new Bing conversation mode builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new type of search interface. Bing conversation mode generates responses using an AI model that has learned by processing a vast amount of text from the Internet. Based on the user query or prompt, the model produces an output that is coherent, relevant, and creative, according to the input and the context. The output can be a response, a web result, a poem, a story, a code, an essay, a song, or anything else that can be expressed in natural language. Bing Image Creator similarly uses an AI model that has learned by processing a vast number of images from the Internet. Based on the user prompt, the model generates an output image. The conversational model is also informed by and refines its output using available context, such as web results, feedback, and interactions, to improve its performance and accuracy. Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page. User activity in these features is governed by the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.

    "Microsoft displays both licensed and crawled news content in its services. Microsoft's licensed news service is Microsoft Start (formally Microsoft News). Microsoft licenses news and other content from publishers that meet Microsoft Start Editorial Standards and displays the full-length article or video on the MSN.com website. Microsoft often displays the headlines and thumbnail images from Microsoft Start content on many Microsoft products, which links to the full article or video content on MSN.com. Microsoft Start content is personalized to users. Information about personalization and settings can be found in the Microsoft Privacy Statement. Microsoft also displays news content crawled and available through the Bing search engine. In response to a user query, Bing will display relevant news search results from the web which link to the third-party websites. Bing has dedicated news home page called Bing News, showing different news categories and a dedicated news search feature where users can search only for news content. Content that appears in Bing news search results must meet specific Bing News Publisher Guidelines, described in detail in the Bing News Publication Hub. Websites interested in being included in the Bing News index may apply through PubHub. Due to local considerations, the Bing News homepage will display only Microsoft Start licensed news content in the News vertical in some markets. Licensed content is marked by the label \"powered by Microsoft Start.\" Also, the Microsoft Start news feed may include Bing News search results in some areas. Bing News search results are marked by labels such as \"from the web\" or the Bing logo. Bing News relies on the same main parameters described above to rank and return content within the Bing News index in response to a user query. More information on how Bing News and Microsoft Start source and rank content is available here. When the same article is available both on a third-party website and on MSN.com or Microsoft Start (as Microsoft licensed content), Bing News search results may display the Microsoft Start version of that content according to its license. This enables a more consistent, higher-quality user experience. Shopping",
    "For your ad to appear at the top of Bing's search engine results page in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, (also called the mainline), it must meet the minimum level of performance. If the ad doesn't meet the minimum level, it can appear in other positions, including on the right side of the page (also called the sidebar), in the middle of the page, or at the bottom of the page. There's nothing wrong with appearing in these positions, though most advertisers strive to get one of the coveted mainline positions as these have the highest click-through rates. For suggestions on how to improve your ad rank and position, see Get my ad to the top of the search results page. Ad position on a Bing search results page",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how "main parameter used for ranking" is defined. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are listed in general order of importance as follows: 

1. Relevance: This refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning.

2. Quality and Credibility: This includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. It also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes factors such as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse, the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship.

3. User engagement: Bing considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query?

4. Freshness: Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh.

5. Location: Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page.

6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result (paragraph 1).

<Question> Does the documentation provide the main parameters used for determining ranking?
<Answers> [
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",

    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "The new Bing conversation mode builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new type of search interface. Bing conversation mode generates responses using an AI model that has learned by processing a vast amount of text from the Internet. Based on the user query or prompt, the model produces an output that is coherent, relevant, and creative, according to the input and the context. The output can be a response, a web result, a poem, a story, a code, an essay, a song, or anything else that can be expressed in natural language. Bing Image Creator similarly uses an AI model that has learned by processing a vast number of images from the Internet. Based on the user prompt, the model generates an output image. The conversational model is also informed by and refines its output using available context, such as web results, feedback, and interactions, to improve its performance and accuracy. Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page. User activity in these features is governed by the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.

You can also segment your Accounts summary or Campaign performance data for Top vs. other. For information on how to do this, see Segment your performance data.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Content creators can use the details as input while writing the content. Bing indexes and ranks unique, high-quality content that is well-researched and relevant to searchers. We recommend that you focus on creating content around your area of expertise, rather than just focusing on top trending topics. Using the tool",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the main parameters used for determining ranking. These parameters, listed in general order of importance, include: 

1. Relevance: This refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning (paragraph 0).

2. Quality and Credibility: This involves evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. It also includes an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes factors such as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse, the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship (paragraph 0).

3. User engagement: Bing considers how users interact with search results. This includes whether users click through to search results for a given query, which results they click on, whether they spend time on these search results or quickly return to Bing, and whether the user adjusts or reformulates their query (paragraph 0).

4. Freshness: Bing generally prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh (paragraph 0).

5. Location: Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page (paragraph 0).

6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result (paragraph 0).

<Question> Does the documentation provide the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking?
<Answers> [
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "These parameters are listed in general order of importance.",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "These are sorted by relevance to the root keyword by default.",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",

    "You can run an account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword performance report and select the Top vs. other column to see performance differences (such as CPC and CTR) between mainline ads and ads in other positions. This can help you optimize your keyword bids to improve performance and increase your ROI. For information on running a performance report, see Create a report. You can also segment your Accounts summary or Campaign performance data for Top vs. other. For information on how to do this, see Segment your performance data.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "2. Items marked in red are high priority, yellow means medium priority, and blue means low priority.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites. Following these guidelines will help with indexing of your site on Bing. It will also help you optimize your site to increase its opportunity to rank for relevant queries in Bing's search results. Please pay special attention to the guidance in the \"Abuse section\" and examples in the \"Things to avoid\" section. Following the guidelines will ensure your site plays by the rules and is not found to be spammy, which could lead to demotion or even delisting your website from Bing search results.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation provides the relative importance of the different main parameters used in determining ranking. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are listed in general order of importance. These parameters include relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. The relative importance of each of these parameters may vary from search to search and evolve over time (paragraph 1).

    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. Bing's ranking mechanism does not generally consider the characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 0 and 8). However, in the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 2 and 13). Furthermore, the ranking mechanism also considers factors such as relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity (paragraph 4 and 11), as well as user engagement, location, and page load time (paragraph 6).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers?
<Answers> [
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users. Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Examples of quality, safety, and user demand",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results.",
    "The FDA, as the predominate federal regulatory body for the pharmaceutical industry in the US, curates this public list of online pharmacies engaged in illegal and unsafe practices.",
    "Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, However, they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing. Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment. Learn more about how paid search ads are ranked within search results.",
    "The new Bing conversation mode builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new type of search interface. Bing conversation mode generates responses using an AI model that has learned by processing a vast amount of text from the Internet. Based on the user query or prompt, the model produces an output that is coherent, relevant, and creative, according to the input and the context. The output can be a response, a web result, a poem, a story, a code, an essay, a song, or anything else that can be expressed in natural language. Bing Image Creator similarly uses an AI model that has learned by processing a vast number of images from the Internet. Based on the user prompt, the model generates an output image. The conversational model is also informed by and refines its output using available context, such as web results, feedback, and interactions, to improve its performance and accuracy. Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page. User activity in these features is governed by the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct. Image and Video experiences",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the characteristics of the goods and services offered to consumers. The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 0 and 5). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 2 and 12). However, websites cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing (paragraph 17).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services, for consumers?
<Answers> [
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users. Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid",
    "2. Items marked in red are high priority, yellow means medium priority, and blue means low priority.",
    "Examples of quality, safety, and user demand",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results. Outside of core algorithmic search results (the \"blue links\"), Bing will sometimes provide a standalone answer box or banner promoting a Microsoft product or service when relevant to the search term provided.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. Bing's ranking mechanism does not directly consider the characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 0 and 8). However, the ranking mechanism does consider factors such as relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity (paragraph 4 and 10). Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query (paragraph 3). Quality and credibility of a website are determined by evaluating factors such as the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation (paragraph 3). User engagement, freshness of content, location, and page load time are also considered in the ranking mechanism (paragraph 3). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 2 and 12).

    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users. Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results.",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results. Outside of core algorithmic search results (the \"blue links\"), Bing will sometimes provide a standalone answer box or banner promoting a Microsoft product or service when relevant to the search term provided.",
    "Some pages captured in the Bing index turn out to be pages of little or no value to users and may also have characteristics that artificially manipulate the way search and advertising systems work in order to distort their relevance relative to pages that offer more relevant information.",
    "Examples of quality, safety, and user demand",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains that the ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the characteristics of the goods and services for consumers. Bing's complex algorithms generate search results using the user's search query, matching it with third-party webpages in their index. The relevance of the content on the landing page to the search query is a key parameter in ranking pages in search results. However, the characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 1, 5, 3). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 2, 12).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?
<Answers> [
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers.",
    "These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites. Following these guidelines will help with indexing of your site on Bing. It will also help you optimize your site to increase its opportunity to rank for relevant queries in Bing's search results. Please pay special attention to the guidance in the \"Abuse section\" and examples in the \"Things to avoid\" section. Following the guidelines will ensure your site plays by the rules and is not found to be spammy, which could lead to demotion or even delisting your website from Bing search results. How Bing finds and indexes your site",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "Links: Links are traditionally regarded as a signal for determining website popularity. The best way to get other sites to link to your site is to create unique and high quality and unique content. Bing's crawler (Bingbot) follows links within your website (internal links) or from other sites (external links) to help Bing discover new content and new pages.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers. Most SEO practices render a website more appealing to Bing; however, performing SEO-related work does not guarantee rankings will improve or sites will receive an increase in traffic from Bing. Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused, resulting in penalties by search engines. These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative, or misleading behaviors. Sites that engage in abuse, such as the practices outlined below, are considered low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action is taken against your site, you can contact our support team through the Bing Webmaster Tools. Additionally, users can report abuse of any of these practices using the feedback link in the footer of bing.com after performing a search that reproduces the issue. An example of this can be seen here.",
    "Our system will scan your URL and report (based on a set of SEO best practices) on the compliance/non-compliance of these SEO best practices by your website.",
    "Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, However, they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing.",
    "These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites.",
    "Bing seeks rich, valuable, and engaging content created for users, not search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on your website, you will increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing your content in search results. Content: Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing. In some cases, it may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. Bing's ranking mechanism considers factors such as relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. The quality and credibility of a website are evaluated based on the clarity of the site's purpose, its usability, presentation, authoritativeness, and the completeness of the content. Bing also considers how users interact with search results, including whether users click through to search results for a given query, spend time on these search results, or adjust or reformulate their query. The freshness of the content and the page load time are also considered in the ranking mechanism. Bing prefers fresh content and views slow page load times as a poor user experience (paragraph 1).

<Question> Does the documentation explain the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites?
<Answers> [
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing.",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers.",
    "Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers. Most SEO practices render a website more appealing to Bing; however, performing SEO-related work does not guarantee rankings will improve or sites will receive an increase in traffic from Bing. Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused, resulting in penalties by search engines. These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative, or misleading behaviors. Sites that engage in abuse, such as the practices outlined below, are considered low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action is taken against your site, you can contact our support team through the Bing Webmaster Tools. Additionally, users can report abuse of any of these practices using the feedback link in the footer of bing.com after performing a search that reproduces the issue. An example of this can be seen here.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites. Following these guidelines will help with indexing of your site on Bing. It will also help you optimize your site to increase its opportunity to rank for relevant queries in Bing's search results. Please pay special attention to the guidance in the \"Abuse section\" and examples in the \"Things to avoid\" section. Following the guidelines will ensure your site plays by the rules and is not found to be spammy, which could lead to demotion or even delisting your website from Bing search results. How Bing finds and indexes your site",
    "Links: Links are traditionally regarded as a signal for determining website popularity. The best way to get other sites to link to your site is to create unique and high quality and unique content. Bing's crawler (Bingbot) follows links within your website (internal links) or from other sites (external links) to help Bing discover new content and new pages.",
    "Our system will scan your URL and report (based on a set of SEO best practices) on the compliance/non-compliance of these SEO best practices by your website.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Some pages captured in the Bing index turn out to be pages of little or no value to users and may also have characteristics that artificially manipulate the way search and advertising systems work in order to distort their relevance relative to pages that offer more relevant information.",
    "Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing.",
    "Bing seeks rich, valuable, and engaging content created for users, not search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on your website, you will increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing your content in search results. Content: Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing. In some cases, it may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the extent to which the ranking mechanism considers the design characteristics of the websites. Bing's ranking mechanism considers the relevance of the content on the landing page to the search query, including matching terms and semantic equivalents (paragraph 2). The quality and credibility of a website are evaluated based on factors such as the clarity of the site's purpose, its usability, presentation, authoritativeness, and the completeness of the content (paragraph 2). User engagement is also considered, including how users interact with search results and their behavior on the webpages (paragraph 2). Other factors include the freshness of the content, the user's location, the page load time, and the location of other visitors to the page (paragraph 2). The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user (paragraph 6). Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing (paragraph 18).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how the ranking mechanism works and, in particular, what the main parameters used are?
<Answers> [
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",

    "The new Bing conversation mode builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new type of search interface. Bing conversation mode generates responses using an AI model that has learned by processing a vast amount of text from the Internet. Based on the user query or prompt, the model produces an output that is coherent, relevant, and creative, according to the input and the context. The output can be a response, a web result, a poem, a story, a code, an essay, a song, or anything else that can be expressed in natural language. Bing Image Creator similarly uses an AI model that has learned by processing a vast number of images from the Internet. Based on the user prompt, the model generates an output image. The conversational model is also informed by and refines its output using available context, such as web results, feedback, and interactions, to improve its performance and accuracy. Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page. User activity in these features is governed by the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct. Image and Video experiences",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",

    "These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites. Following these guidelines will help with indexing of your site on Bing. It will also help you optimize your site to increase its opportunity to rank for relevant queries in Bing's search results. Please pay special attention to the guidance in the \"Abuse section\" and examples in the \"Things to avoid\" section. Following the guidelines will ensure your site plays by the rules and is not found to be spammy, which could lead to demotion or even delisting your website from Bing search results.

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how the ranking mechanism works and the main parameters used. The ranking mechanism is based on complex algorithms that use machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. The main parameters used to rank pages in search results, listed in general order of importance, are: 

1. Relevance: This refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning (paragraph 0).

2. Quality and Credibility: This includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. It also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse, the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship (paragraph 0).

3. User engagement: Bing considers how users interact with search results. This includes whether users click through to search results for a given query, which results they click on, whether they spend time on these search results or quickly return to Bing, and whether the user adjusts or reformulates their query (paragraph 0).

4. Freshness: Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh (paragraph 0).

5. Location: Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page (paragraph 0).

6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result (paragraph 0). 

For ad ranking, the position is determined by multiple factors, including the amount you bid for your keyword, your ad's relevance, and your ad's performance, based on various response signals, for example, click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 1).

    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

    "Bing seeks rich, valuable, and engaging content created for users, not search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on your website, you will increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing your content in search results. Content: Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing. In some cases, it may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains what is most important in determining ranking. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are listed in general order of importance: Relevance, Quality and Credibility, User engagement, Freshness, Location, and Page load time. Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Quality and Credibility of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. User engagement considers how users interact with search results. Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information is. Location takes into account the user's location, where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. Page load time is also important as slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere (paragraph 3). 

Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: The amount you bid for your keyword, your ad's relevance, and your ad's performance, based on various response signals—for example, click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 2). 

Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content (paragraph 10).

<Question> Does the documentation explain why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "These parameters are listed in general order of importance.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity.",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places. News",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.",
    "Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1.",
    "2. Items marked in red are high priority, yellow means medium priority, and blue means low priority.",
    "These are sorted by relevance to the root keyword by default.",
    "Examples of quality, safety, and user demand",
    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",
    "You can run an account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword performance report and select the Top vs. other column to see performance differences (such as CPC and CTR) between mainline ads and ads in other positions.",
    "Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above.",
    "Bing News relies on the same main parameters described above to rank and return content within the Bing News index in response to a user query.",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains why specific parameters were selected as the main factors in determining the ranking of goods or services. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. Quality and credibility of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. User engagement considers how users interact with search results. Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information on the page is. Location takes into account the user's location, where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. Page load time is important as slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave a website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result (paragraph 2).

    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",

    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3.

    "Bing's image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content. Maps",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains the internal process conducted by the provider to determine the main parameters for the ranking of goods or services. The main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results are relevance, quality and credibility, user engagement, freshness, location, and page load time. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing uses complex algorithms and machine learning to identify patterns in data and generalize based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals (paragraph 2). The ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content (paragraph 4). The ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity (paragraph 5). Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including the amount you bid for your keyword, your ad's relevance, and your ad's performance, based on various response signals—for example, click-through rate (CTR) (paragraph 7). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 8).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services?
<Answers> [
    "Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, However, they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "For suggestions on how to improve your ad rank and position, see Get my ad to the top of the search results page.",
    "2. You can stand out from the crowd and attract attention by sharing images, product ratings and promotions of the products you're selling.",
    "Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment.",
    "Bing seeks rich, valuable, and engaging content created for users, not search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on your website, you will increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing your content in search results. Content: Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing. In some cases, it may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "Why use product ads? 1. Stand out from the crowd... 2. You can stand out from the crowd and attract attention by sharing images, product ratings and promotions of the products you're selling. 3. More real estate 4. Product Ads enable you to highlight more than one product on the same search results page and can appear next to your text ads. 5. Easy setup 6. If you're already running Google Shopping Campaigns, it's easy to import them directly into your Microsoft Advertising account.",
    "Drive more customers to your products with engaging retail experiences through Shopping Campaigns. Product ads showcase products in impactful ways that can include custom images, pricing or your company name - putting searchers closer to making a purchasing decision even before they click.",
    "These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users. Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid",
    "This can help you optimize your keyword bids to improve performance and increase your ROI.",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user's search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available. Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing's ranking goals. Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing's complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime: 1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content. 2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page's authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author's or site's reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it's data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages. 4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly. 5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user's location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page. 6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to \"Strict\" mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority.",
    "In furtherance of Bing's commitment to provide users with trustworthy results, Bing has taken steps to minimize the likelihood that users are harmed through pharmaceutical sales online.",
    "Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results.",
    "You can run an account, campaign, ad group, ad, or keyword performance report and select the Top vs. other column to see performance differences (such as CPC and CTR) between mainline ads and ads in other positions. This can help you optimize your keyword bids to improve performance and increase your ROI. For information on running a performance report, see Create a report. You can also segment your Accounts summary or Campaign performance data for Top vs. other. For information on how to do this, see Segment your performance data.",

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation does explain how users can improve the ranking of their goods or services. Users can improve their ad rank and position by following suggestions provided by Bing (paragraph 3). They can also stand out by sharing images, product ratings, and promotions of the products they're selling (paragraph 4, 8). In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 7, 11). Users can also optimize their keyword bids to improve performance and increase their ROI (paragraph 12, 18). Furthermore, creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on the website can increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing the content in search results (paragraph 6).

<Question> Does the documentation explain how users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct or indirect payments to the provider, and what effect this has?
<Answers> [
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users.

    "Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment.",
    "In furtherance of Bing's commitment to provide users with trustworthy results, Bing has taken steps to minimize the likelihood that users are harmed through pharmaceutical sales online.",
    "Affiliate programs without adding sufficient value: Websites that link products from other websites (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.)",
    "but pretend that they are an official retailer or in affiliation with those sites are called Thin Affiliation sites, and they add little to no incremental value (like extra reviews, search functionality, Editor's Choice, etc.).",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "Affiliate programs without adding sufficient value: Websites that link products from other websites (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.) but pretend that they are an official retailer or in affiliation with those sites are called Thin Affiliation sites, and they add little to no incremental value (like extra reviews, search functionality, Editor's Choice, etc.). and are only intended to take credit for other content. It can lead to demotion or even delisting your website from our search results.",
    "Abusive tactics that aim to inflate the number and nature of inbound links, such as links buying participating in link schemes (link farms, link spamming and excessive link manipulation) can lead to your site being penalized and delisted from the Bing index.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "Drive more customers to your products with engaging retail experiences through Shopping Campaigns. Product ads showcase products in impactful ways that can include custom images, pricing or your company name - putting searchers closer to making a purchasing decision even before they click.",
    "Link Schemes, Link Buying, Link Spamming: While link schemes may succeed in increasing the number of links pointing to your website, they will fail to bring quality links to your site, netting your site no positive gains. Manipulating inbound links to artificially inflate the number of links pointing to a website can lead to your site being delisted from the Bing index.",
    "Make a reasonable effort to ensure that any paid or advertisement links on your site use rel=\"nofollow\" or rel=\"sponsored\" or rel=\"ugc\" attribute to prevent the links from being followed by a crawler and from potentially impacting search rankings.",
    "Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.",
    "The money we accrue from advertising is shared with those publishers in order to help sustain a free press, and to pay the costs of providing the content to you.",
    "Bing may enhance the results page with additional features to provide a richer search experience for some search queries. For example, if a user types \"How tall is the Eiffel Tower?\" Bing will respond with the answer of \"300 m\". For some queries, Bing looks at search results across the web, returns a summarized answer, and links to its sources. If the query is related to a business, Bing may return relevant information about the business, such as store hours and location. Business owners can claim and verify existing listings on Bing using Bing Places for Business (available in limited markets) to create, edit or update their listing information. In some cases, Bing may partner with third-party content providers, such as local restaurant review sites, to further enhance the user experience. Conversation Mode and Bing Image Creator",
    "Ad position is where your ads appear on Bing, AOL, Yahoo, or a partner site's search engine results page. Your ad's position is determined by how it ranks against competing ads. Ad rank is determined by multiple factors, including: 1. The amount you bid for your keyword. For more information, see What are keyword bids. 2. Your ad's relevance. 3. Your ad's performance, based on various response signalsaEUR\"for example, click-through rate (CTR).",
    "Social media schemes: Social media schemes are similar to link farms in that they seek to artificially exploit a network effect to game Bing's algorithm. The reality is that social media schemes are easy to see in action, and the website's value is deprecated. One such example is auto follow. Auto follows encourage follower growth on social sites such as Twitter, and work by automatically following anyone who follows you. Over time this creates a scenario where the number of followers you have is more or less the same as the number of people following you. This does not indicate you have a strong influence. Following few people while having a high follower count would indicate a stronger influential voice."

<Final Answer> Yes, the documentation explains how users can alter the ranking of their products or services through direct or indirect payments to the provider. In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program (paragraph 0 and 1). However, websites cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing (paragraph 2 and 3). The documentation also explains that the ad position, which can affect the visibility of products or services, is determined by multiple factors including the amount bid for a keyword (paragraph 18).

<Question> Does the documentation explain what the business logic behind allowing users to affect the ranking of their products or services through payments is, and what the potential consequences of this are?
<Answers> [
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program.",
    "In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data. Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user's query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing's ranking of coupons shown to users. Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid",
    "Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, However, they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing. Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment. Learn more about how paid search ads are ranked within search results.",
    "Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment.",
    "Affiliate programs without adding sufficient value: Websites that link products from other websites (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.)",
    "The money we accrue from advertising is shared with those publishers in order to help sustain a free press, and to pay the costs of providing the content to you.",
    "but pretend that they are an official retailer or in affiliation with those sites are called Thin Affiliation sites, and they add little to no incremental value (like extra reviews, search functionality, Editor's Choice, etc.).",
    "Affiliate programs without adding sufficient value: Websites that link products from other websites (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.) but pretend that they are an official retailer or in affiliation with those sites are called Thin Affiliation sites, and they add little to no incremental value (like extra reviews, search functionality, Editor's Choice, etc.). and are only intended to take credit for other content. It can lead to demotion or even delisting your website from our search results.",
    "Abusive tactics that aim to inflate the number and nature of inbound links, such as links buying participating in link schemes (link farms, link spamming and excessive link manipulation) can lead to your site being penalized and delisted from the Bing index.",
    "In furtherance of Bing's commitment to provide users with trustworthy results, Bing has taken steps to minimize the likelihood that users are harmed through pharmaceutical sales online.",
    "There could even be a compelling monetary case made here for some businesses.",
    "Make a reasonable effort to ensure that any paid or advertisement links on your site use rel=\"nofollow\" or rel=\"sponsored\" or rel=\"ugc\" attribute to prevent the links from being followed by a crawler and from potentially impacting search rankings.",
    "Link Schemes, Link Buying, Link Spamming: While link schemes may succeed in increasing the number of links pointing to your website, they will fail to bring quality links to your site, netting your site no positive gains. Manipulating inbound links to artificially inflate the number of links pointing to a website can lead to your site being delisted from the Bing index.",
    "Drive more customers to your products with engaging retail experiences through Shopping Campaigns. Product ads showcase products in impactful ways that can include custom images, pricing or your company name - putting searchers closer to making a purchasing decision even before they click.",
    "Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers. Most SEO practices render a website more appealing to Bing; however, performing SEO-related work does not guarantee rankings will improve or sites will receive an increase in traffic from Bing. Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused, resulting in penalties by search engines. These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative, or misleading behaviors. Sites that engage in abuse, such as the practices outlined below, are considered low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action is taken against your site, you can contact our support team through the Bing Webmaster Tools. Additionally, users can report abuse of any of these practices using the feedback link in the footer of bing.com after performing a search that reproduces the issue. An example of this can be seen here.",
    "For example, if you sell shoes and bid on the keyword \"shoe,\" you'll have to beat the ad rank of the other advertisers who are also bidding on \"shoe.\"",
    "For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges.",
    "Bing rewards links that have grown organically; links added over time by content creators on other trusted, relevant websites that drive real users from their site to yours.",
    "The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user.",
    "Why use product ads? 1. Stand out from the crowd... 2. You can stand out from the crowd and attract attention by sharing images, product ratings and promotions of the products you're selling. 3. More real estate 4. Product Ads enable you to highlight more than one product on the same search results page and can appear next to your text ads. 5. Easy setup 6. If you're already running Google Shopping Campaigns, it's easy to import them directly into your Microsoft Advertising account."
