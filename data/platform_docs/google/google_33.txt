Dataset (Dataset, DataCatalog, DataDownload) structured data

Datasets are easier to find when you provide supporting information such as their name, description, creator and distribution formats as structured data. Google's approach to dataset discovery makes use of schema.org and other metadata standards that can be added to pages that describe datasets. The purpose of this markup is to improve discovery of datasets from fields such as life sciences, social sciences, machine learning, civic and government data, and more. You can find datasets by using the Dataset Search tool.
example of Dataset Search
Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test.

Here are some examples of what can qualify as a dataset:

    A table or a CSV file with some data
    An organized collection of tables
    A file in a proprietary format that contains data
    A collection of files that together constitute some meaningful dataset
    A structured object with data in some other format that you might want to load into a special tool for processing
    Images capturing data
    Files relating to machine learning, such as trained parameters or neural network structure definitions

How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the structured data codelab.

    Add the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
    Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
    Using JavaScript? Learn how to generate structured data with JavaScript.
    Follow the guidelines.
    Validate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
    Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
    Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.

Deleting a dataset from Dataset Search results

If you don't want a dataset to show up in Dataset Search results, use the robots meta tag to control how your dataset is indexed. Keep in mind that it might take some time (days or weeks, depending on the crawl schedule) for the changes to be reflected on Dataset Search.
Our approach to dataset discovery

We can understand structured data in Web pages about datasets, using either schema.org Dataset markup, or equivalent structures represented in W3C's Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) format. We also are exploring experimental support for structured data based on W3C CSVW, and expect to evolve and adapt our approach as best practices for dataset description emerge. For more information about our approach to dataset discovery, see Making it easier to discover datasets.
Examples

Here's an example for datasets using JSON-LD and schema.org syntax (preferred) in the Rich Results Test. The same schema.org vocabulary can also be used in RDFa 1.1 or Microdata syntaxes. You can also use the W3C DCAT vocabulary to describe the metadata. The following example is based on a real-world dataset description.
Guidelines

Sites must follow the structured data guidelines. In addition to the structured data guidelines, we recommend the following sitemap and source and provenance best practices.
Sitemap best practices

Use a sitemap file to help Google find your URLs. Using sitemap files and sameAs markup helps document how dataset descriptions are published throughout your site.

If you have a dataset repository, you likely have at least two types of pages: the canonical ("landing") pages for each dataset and pages that list multiple datasets (for example, search results, or some subset of datasets). We recommend that you add structured data about a dataset to the canonical pages. Use the sameAs property to link to the canonical page if you add structured data to multiple copies of the dataset, such as listings in search results pages.
Google doesn't need every mention of the same dataset to be explicitly marked up, but if you do so for other reasons, we strongly encourage the use of sameAs.
Source and provenance best practices

It is common for open datasets to be republished, aggregated, and to be based on other datasets. This is an initial outline of our approach to representing situations in which a dataset is a copy of, or otherwise based upon, another dataset.

    Use the sameAs property to indicate the most canonical URLs for the original in cases when the dataset or description is a simple republication of materials published elsewhere. The value of sameAs needs to unambiguously indicate the dataset's identity - in other words, don't use the same sameAs value for two different datasets.
    Use the isBasedOn property in cases where the republished dataset (including its metadata) has been changed significantly.
    When a dataset derives from or aggregates several originals, use the isBasedOn property.
    Use the identifier property to attach any relevant Digital Object identifiers (DOIs) or Compact Identifiers. If the dataset has more than one identifier, repeat the identifier property. If using JSON-LD, this is represented using JSON list syntax.

We hope to improve our recommendations based on feedback, in particular around the description of provenance, versioning, and the dates associated with time series publication. Please join in community discussions.
Textual property recommendations

We recommend limiting all textual properties to 5000 characters or less. Google Dataset Search only uses the first 5000 characters of any textual property. Names and titles are typically a few words or a short sentence.
Known Errors and Warnings

You may experience errors or warnings in Google's Rich Results Test and other validation systems. Specifically, validation systems may suggest that organizations must have contact information including a contactType; useful values include customer service, emergency, journalist, newsroom, and public engagement. You can also ignore errors for csvw:Table being an unexpected value for the mainEntity property.
Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.

You can use the Rich Results Test to validate your markup.

The focus is on describing information about a dataset (its metadata) and representing its contents. For example, dataset metadata states what the dataset is about, which variables it measures, who created it, and so on. It does not, for example, contain specific values for the variables.
Dataset

The full definition of Dataset is available at schema.org/Dataset.

You can describe additional information about the publication of the dataset, such as the license, when it was published, its DOI, or a sameAs pointing to a canonical version of the dataset in a different repository. Add identifier, license, and sameAs for datasets that provide provenance and license information.

The Google-supported properties are the following:
Required properties
description 	Text

A short summary describing a dataset.

Guidelines

    The summary must be between 50 and 5000 characters long.
    The summary may include Markdown syntax. Embedded images need to use absolute path URLs (instead of relative paths).
    When using the JSON-LD format, denote new lines with \n (two characters: backslash and lower case letter "n").

name 	Text

A descriptive name of a dataset. For example, "Snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere".

Guidelines

    Use unique names for distinct datasets whenever possible.

    Recommended: "Snow depth in the Northern Hemisphere" and "Snow depth in the Southern Hemisphere" for two different datasets.

    Not recommended: "Snow depth" and "Snow depth" for two different datasets.

Recommended properties
alternateName 	Text

Alternative names that have been used to refer to this dataset, such as aliases or abbreviations. Example (in JSON-LD format):

"name": "The Quick, Draw! Dataset"
"alternateName": ["Quick Draw Dataset", "quickdraw-dataset"]

creator 	Person or Organization

The creator or author of this dataset. To uniquely identify individuals, use ORCID ID as the value of the sameAs property of the Person type. To uniquely identify institutions and organizations, use ROR ID. Example (in JSON-LD format):

"creator": [
  {
    "@type": "Person",
    "sameAs": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0000",
    "givenName": "Jane",
    "familyName": "Foo",
    "name": "Jane Foo"
  },
  {
    "@type": "Person",
    "sameAs": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0001",
    "givenName": "Jo",
    "familyName": "Bar",
    "name": "Jo Bar"
  },
  {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "sameAs": "https://ror.org/xxxxxxxxx",
    "name": "Fictitious Research Consortium"
  }
]

citation 	Text or CreativeWork

Identifies academic articles that are recommended by the data provider be cited in addition to the dataset itself. Provide the citation for the dataset itself with other properties, such as name, identifier, creator, and publisher properties. For example, this property can uniquely identify a related academic publication such as a data descriptor, data paper, or an article for which this dataset is supplementary material for. Examples (in JSON-LD format):

"citation": "https://doi.org/10.1111/111"

"citation": "https://identifiers.org/pubmed:11111111"

"citation": "https://identifiers.org/arxiv:0111.1111v1"

"citation":
 "Doe J (2014) Influence of X ... https://doi.org/10.1111/111"

Additional guidelines

    Don't use this property to provide citation information for the dataset itself. It is intended to identify related academic articles, not the dataset itself. To provide information necessary to cite the dataset itself use name, identifier, creator, and publisher properties instead.
    When populating the citation property with a citation snippet, provide the article identifier (such as a DOI) whenever possible.

    Recommended: "Doe J (2014) Influence of X. Biomics 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1111/111"

    Not recommended: "Doe J (2014) Influence of X. Biomics 1(1)."

funder 	Person or Organization

A person or organization that provides financial support for this dataset. To uniquely identify individuals, use ORCID ID as the value of the sameAs property of the Person type. To uniquely identify institutions and organizations, use ROR ID. Example (in JSON-LD format):

"funder": [
  {
    "@type": "Person",
    "sameAs": "https://orcid.org/0000-0000-0000-0002",
    "givenName": "Jane",
    "familyName": "Funder",
    "name": "Jane Funder"
  },
  {
    "@type": "Organization",
    "sameAs": "https://ror.org/yyyyyyyyy",
    "name": "Fictitious Funding Organization"
  }
]

hasPart or isPartOf 	URL or Dataset

If the dataset is a collection of smaller datasets, use the hasPart property to denote such relationship. Conversly, if the dataset is part of a larger dataset, use isPartOf. Both properties can take the form of a URL or a Dataset instance. In case Dataset is used as a value it has to include all of the properties required for a standalone Dataset. Examples:

"hasPart" : [
  {
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "Sub dataset 01",
    "description": "Informative description of the first subdataset...",
    "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
    "creator": {
      "@type":"Organization",
      "name": "Sub dataset 01 creator"
    }
  },
  {
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "Sub dataset 02",
    "description": "Informative description of the second subdataset...",
    "license": "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/",
    "creator": {
      "@type":"Organization",
      "name": "Sub dataset 02 creator"
    }
  }
]

"isPartOf" : "https://example.com/aggregate_dataset"

identifier 	URL, Text, or PropertyValue

An identifier, such as a DOI or a Compact Identifier. If the dataset has more than one identifier, repeat the identifier property. If using JSON-LD, this is represented using JSON list syntax.
isAccessibleForFree 	Boolean

Whether the dataset is accessible without payment.
keywords 	Text

Keywords summarizing the dataset.
license 	URL or CreativeWork

A license under which the dataset is distributed. For example:

"license" : "https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"

"license" : {
  "@type": "CreativeWork",
  "name": "Custom license",
  "url": "https://example.com/custom_license"
  }

Additional guidelines

    Provide a URL that unambiguously identifies a specific version of the license used.

    Recommended

    "license" : "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0"

    Not recommended

    "license" : "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by"

measurementTechnique 	Text or URL

The technique, technology, or methodology used in a dataset, which can correspond to the variable(s) described in variableMeasured.
The measurementTechnique property is proposed and pending standardization at schema.org. We encourage publishers to share any feedback on this property with the schema.org community.
sameAs 	URL

The URL of a reference web page that unambiguously indicates the dataset's identity.
spatialCoverage 	Text or Place

You can provide a single point that describes the spatial aspect of the dataset. Only include this property if the dataset has a spatial dimension. For example, a single point where all the measurements were collected, or the coordinates of a bounding box for an area.

Points

"spatialCoverage:" {
  "@type": "Place",
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoCoordinates",
    "latitude": 39.3280,
    "longitude": 120.1633
  }
}

Shapes

Use GeoShape to describe areas of different shapes. For example, to specify a bounding box.

"spatialCoverage:" {
  "@type": "Place",
  "geo": {
    "@type": "GeoShape",
    "box": "39.3280 120.1633 40.445 123.7878"
  }
}

Points inside box, circle, line, or polygon properties must be expressed as a space separated pair of two values corresponding to latitude and longitude (in that order).

Named locations

"spatialCoverage:" "Tahoe City, CA"

temporalCoverage 	Text

The data in the dataset covers a specific time interval. Only include this property if the dataset has a temporal dimension. Schema.org uses the ISO 8601 standard to describe time intervals and time points. You can describe dates differently depending upon the dataset interval. Indicate open-ended intervals with two decimal points (..).

Single date

"temporalCoverage" : "2008"

Time period

"temporalCoverage" : "1950-01-01/2013-12-18"

Open-ended time period

"temporalCoverage" : "2013-12-19/.."

variableMeasured 	Text or PropertyValue

The variable that this dataset measures. For example, temperature or pressure.
The variableMeasured property is proposed and pending standardization at schema.org. We encourage publishers to share any feedback on this property with the schema.org community.
version 	Text or Number

The version number for the dataset.
url 	URL

Location of a page describing the dataset.
DataCatalog

The full definition of DataCatalog is available at schema.org/DataCatalog.

Datasets are often published in repositories that contain many other datasets. The same dataset can be included in more than one such repository. You can refer to a data catalog that this dataset belongs to by referencing it directly by using the following properties:
Recommended properties
includedInDataCatalog 	DataCatalog

The catalog to which the dataset belongs.

DataDownload

The full definition of DataDownload is available at schema.org/DataDownload. In addition to Dataset properties, add the following properties for datasets that provide download options.

The distribution property describes how to get the dataset itself because the URL often points to the landing page describing the dataset. The distribution property describes where to get the data and in what format. This property can have several values: for instance, a CSV version has one URL and an Excel version is available at another.
Required properties
distribution.contentUrl 	URL

The link for the download.
Recommended properties
distribution 	DataDownload

The description of the location for download of the dataset and the file format for download.

distribution.encodingFormat 	Text or URL

The file format of the distribution.

Tabular datasets
Beta: This approach is currently in beta and therefore subject to change.

A tabular dataset is one organized primarily in terms of a grid of rows and columns. For pages that embed tabular datasets, you can also create more explicit markup, building on the basic approach. At this time we understand a variation of CSVW ("CSV on the Web", see W3C), provided in parallel to user-oriented tabular content on the HTML page.

Here is an example showing a small table encoded in CSVW JSON-LD format. There are some known errors in the Rich Results Test.

Monitor rich results with Search Console

Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:

    After deploying structured data for the first time
    After releasing new templates or updating your code
    Analyzing traffic periodically

After deploying structured data for the first time

After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant Rich result status report. Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:

    Fix the invalid items.
    Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
    Request validation using the status report.

After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.

    If you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.
    If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.

Warning: Don't use cached links to debug your pages. Instead, use the URL Inspection Tool because it has the most up-to-date version of your pages.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report. The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the Search Console API.
Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

    If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
    Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.
    You might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors.
    If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.
    Review the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.
    Troubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
    Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
    Post a question in the Google Search Central forum.

Specific dataset isn't showing up in Dataset Search results

error What caused the issue: Your site doesn't have structured data on the page that describes the datasets or the page hasn't been crawled yet.

done Fix the issue

    Copy the link for the page that you expect to see in Dataset Search results, and put it into the Rich Results Test. If the message "Page not eligible for rich results known by this test" or "Not all markup is eligible for rich results" appears, this means there's no Dataset markup on the page or it's incorrect. You can fix it by referring to the How to add structured data section.
    If there is markup on the page, it may not have been crawled yet. You can check the crawl status with Search Console.

Company logo is missing or not appearing correctly by results

error What caused the issue: Your page may be missing schema.org markup for organization logos or your business isn't established with Google.

done Fix the issue

    Add logo structured data to your page.
    Establish your business details with Google.
