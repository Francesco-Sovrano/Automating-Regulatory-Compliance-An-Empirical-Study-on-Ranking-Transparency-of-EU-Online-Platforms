Math solver (MathSolver) structured data

To help students, teachers, and others with math problems, you can use structured data to indicate the type of math problems and links to step-by-step walkthroughs for specific math problems. Here's an example of how math solvers may look in Google Search results (the appearance is subject to change):

Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test.
How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the structured data codelab.

    Add the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
    Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
    Using JavaScript? Learn how to generate structured data with JavaScript.
    Follow the guidelines.
    Validate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
    Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
    Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.

Examples
One solver action

Here's an example of a math solver home page that has one solver action that can solve polynomial equations and derivative problems and is available in English and Spanish.

Two solver actions

Here's an example of a math solver home page that has two solver endpoints: one endpoint can solve polynomial equations and the other endpoint can solve trigonometric equations. It is available only in English.

Guidelines

For your page to be eligible for math solver rich results, you must follow these guidelines:

    General structured data guidelines
    Search Essentials
    Technical guidelines
    Content guidelines

Technical Guidelines

    Add MathSolver structured data to the home page of your site.
    Ensure that your host load settings allow for frequent crawls.
    If you have several identical copies of the same math solver hosted under different URLs, use the canonical URLs on each copy of the page.
    We don't allow math solvers that are entirely hidden behind a login or paywall. Once users navigate from the feature on Google to your site, the solution and a step-by-step walkthrough for their initial problem must be accessible to them. Additional content can be behind a login or paywall.

Content guidelines

We created these Math Solver content guidelines to ensure that our users are connected with learning resources that are relevant. If we find content that violates these policies, we'll respond appropriately, which may include taking manual action and removing your pages from appearing in the math solver experience on Google.

    We don't allow promotional content disguised as a math solver, such as those posted by a third party (for example, affiliate programs).
    You are responsible for the accuracy and quality of your math solver through this feature. If a certain amount of your data is found to be inaccurate based on our quality review processes, then your solver may be removed from the feature until you resolve the issues depending on the severity. This applies to:
        The accuracy of the problem types your solver is capable of solving.
        The accuracy of your solutions for math problems your solver declares it can solve.

Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could provide a better user experience.
MathSolver

A MathSolver is a tool that assists students, teachers, and others with math problems by laying out step-by-step solutions. Use MathSolver structured data on your site's home page.

The full definition of MathSolver is available at schema.org/MathSolver.

The Google-supported properties are the following:
Required properties
potentialAction 	

SolveMathAction

The action that leads to a mathematical explanation (for example, step-by-step solution or graph) of a math expression.

{
"@type": "MathSolver",
"potentialAction": [{
  "@type": "SolveMathAction",
  "target": "https://mathdomain.com/solve?q={math_expression_string}",
  "mathExpression-input": "required name=math_expression_string",
  "eduQuestionType": "Polynomial Equation"
  }]
}

potentialAction.mathExpression-input 	

Text

A placeholder for a mathematical expression (for example: x^2-3x=0) that is sent by Google to your website. You can then "solve" the math expression, which may involve simplifying, transforming, or solving for a specific variable. The string can take many formats (for example: LaTeX, Ascii-Math, or mathematical expressions that you can write with a keyboard).
mathExpression-input is an annotated property. See the Potential Actions page for more information.

For some problem types, the math_expression_string indicates both the problem type and parameters of the problem type. Here are some examples of the more complicated problem types so that you can anticipate and parse them correctly.

Derivatives

Google will send a math_expression_string in one of two forms:

    (math_expression)'

    d/dvariable math_expression

Examples:

    (x^2+x)'
    d/dx (x^2+x)
    d/dy y^2+y

Integrals

Google will send a math_expression_string in one of two forms:

    \int math_expression

    \int_{from}^{to} math_expression

Examples:

    \int x^2+x
    \int_{0}^{2} x^2+x

Limits

Google will send a math_expression_string in one of two forms:

    \lim math_expression

    \lim_{variable\rightarrowvalue} math_expression

Examples:

    \lim_{x\rightarrow0} sin(x)/x
    \lim_{y\rightarrow\infty} sin(y)/y
    \lim sin(x)/x
