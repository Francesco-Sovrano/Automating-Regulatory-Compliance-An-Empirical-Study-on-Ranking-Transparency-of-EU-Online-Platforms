Visual Elements gallery of Google Search

Visual elements are the building blocks of the Google Search results page that a user can perceive or interact with. The Visual Elements gallery is an illustrated guide to the most common UI elements of Google web search: it explains what the elements look like, what they're called, and whether you can optimize your website for each element.
Anatomy of a Google Search results page

The Google Search results page contains a set of different types of search result visual elements, and each search result has its own set of possible child visual elements. For example, a text result is a visual element in its own right, and it has various child visual elements, such as attribution, title link, and snippet.

How the visual elements look can change over time, and a given result can be displayed differently depending on whether you're using a desktop computer or a phone, what country you're in, the language of your search query, and many other factors. Here are the most common types of search result visual elements that you might see in Google Search:
