		<p>To learn how your offers can become the Featured Offer, watch this Seller University video.
		</p>

		<p>The <strong>Featured Offer</strong> is the offer near the top of a product detail page that customers can buy now or add to their shopping basket.</p>


		<p>A key feature of the Amazon website is that the same product can be sold by several sellers. If several sellers offer the same product in “new” condition, they may be eligible to compete for the Featured Offer for that product (as long as it can be shipped to the customer's selected address).</p>



		<p>To give customers the best possible shopping experience, sellers must meet performance-based requirements to be eligible to compete for Featured Offer placement. For many sellers, Featured Offer placement can lead to increased sales.</p>


		<p>When a seller becomes the Featured Offer on an offer's product detail page, that seller's specific information (respective offer price and seller name) will be displayed on the product detail page. 
			
		<strong>Note: </strong>Seller offerings for Music and DVD products are eligible for the Featured Offer if fulfilled through Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA). Video (VHS) listings are not eligible to appear as the Featured Offer on the product detail page.</p>




		<p>From January 28, 2021, sellers are able to become the Amazon UK Books Featured Offer. Only “New” condition books are eligible.</p>
