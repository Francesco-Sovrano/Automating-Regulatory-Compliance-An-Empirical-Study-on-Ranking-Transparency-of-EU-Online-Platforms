<span>The Buy Box is the display on a <strong>product detail</strong> page with the <strong>Add to basket</strong> button that customers can use to add items to their shopping carts.</span>   <span>When one of your listed items appears as the default on the product page, you “win” the Buy Box, increasing your chances of selling that item.</span> 
<strong>Note: </strong>Becoming eligible to win the Buy Box doesn't guarantee that you will win it; that said, there are a few things you can do to increase your chances. The “Buy Used Box” is not available in many categories, and availability is subject to change at the category's discretion. To learn more, see <a class="same_window" href="/gp/help/external/201687550?locale=en-GB" target="_self">Winning the Buy Box</a>.

<p>If you are a Fulfilment by Amazon (FBA) seller, your FBA new offers are automatically eligible to win the Buy Box. Otherwise, you must meet all of the conditions listed below. Amazon does not guarantee placement in the Buy Box.
1. Type of selling account: You must have a Professional selling account. 
2. Performance Metrics: Your Order Defect Rate, Cancellation Rate, and Late Shipment Rate are metrics that determine eligibility - the better you perform, the higher your chances are of becoming Buy Box eligible. You can see how you are doing on the Account Health page.
3. Order volume: In order for Amazon to accurately assess your performance, we require that you have sufficient order volume (which varies among categories).</p>
