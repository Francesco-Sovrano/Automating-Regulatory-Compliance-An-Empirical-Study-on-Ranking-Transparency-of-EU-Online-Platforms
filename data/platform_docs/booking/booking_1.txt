Welcome to Booking.com! As a new accommodation partner, we'll introduce you to our marketplace and how it works. We'll also cover some important concepts to help you get started. Let's begin your journey!

About Booking.com

Booking.com was founded in 1996, and our mission is to make it easier for everyone to experience the world. We offer over 28 million accommodation listings, including more than 6.6 million unique homes, apartments, and other places to stay.

As an accommodation partner, your peace of mind is our top priority. We provide a range of products and services to help you professionally manage your property listing and feel confident in your decisions, so you can provide a warm welcome to your guests.

Our global marketplace

At Booking.com, we've built a marketplace that connects demand from guests all over the world with supply from you. While we also offer transportation options and attraction reservations, when it comes to booking accommodations, this is how it works:
1. Guests (Demand): Guests are the people that search for and book stays at properties such as yours that are listed on Booking.com. As a partner, you have access to a global audience of guests.
2. Accommodation partner (Supply): Partners, like you, list their properties on our platform, and we advertise and promote them to guests from all over the world. We facilitate the reservation process from start to finish.

Capturing demand

As a Booking.com partner you have immediate access to a wide range of tools, products and services that can help you set up strong foundations - as well as improve in areas that are most important to you. 

You’ll discover these in the future stages of your onboarding journey with us, but to get you started a simple way to visualise this is to think of two key areas where Booking.com brings you value:
1. Visibility: On Booking.com guests from the entire world are within a few clicks of discovering your property. We help you find opportunities to rank well in search results for the guests that matter most to you and your business.
2. Conversion: Ranking well in search results is important, but the ultimate goal is to secure a booking at your property. Our platform facilitates a smooth and secure booking experience that encourages guests to commit to a stay at your property, ultimately helping you to get more bookings.
