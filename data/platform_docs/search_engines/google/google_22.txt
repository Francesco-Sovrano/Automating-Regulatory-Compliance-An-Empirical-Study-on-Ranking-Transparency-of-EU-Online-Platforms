Learning video (LearningResource, VideoObject, Clip) structured data Example of a Learning Video rich result

Google Search is an entry point for students and teachers to discover and watch educational videos. When you explicitly provide learning-specific information with structured data, such as the educational level and concept and skills covered in the video, Google can better understand the content in your video, and provide an enhanced experience to help learners find the right content.

Learning video structured data may also enable information chips about the learning video, like the educational level and what type of video it is (for example, an overview or a solution video).
How information chips can appear below a learning video, before the user taps the video How information chips can appear above a learning video, after the user taps the video
Feature availability

The Learning Video rich result is available in English in all regions where Google Search is available. The feature is only available when searching for academic learning content on desktop and mobile.

How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the structured data codelab.

    Add the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
    Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
    Using JavaScript? Learn how to generate structured data with JavaScript.
    Follow the guidelines.
    Validate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
    Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
    Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.

Guidelines

For your page to be eligible for Learning Video rich results, you must follow these guidelines:
Warning: If your site violates one or more of these guidelines, then Google may take manual action against it. Once you have remedied the problem, you can submit your site for reconsideration.

    General structured data guidelines
    Search Essentials
    Video best practices
    Video sitemap guidelines
    Technical guidelines

Technical guidelines

    In addition to Learning Video markup, you must add the VideoObject required and recommended properties.
    The video must be publicly available to watch without a subscription.
    The total video duration must be a minimum of 30 seconds.
    Learning Video markup must be added to a page where users can watch the video. It's a bad user experience to point users to a page where they can't watch the video.

Structured data type definitions

The full definition of VideoObject and LearningResource is available on schema.org VideoObject and LearningResource.

You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a Learning Video rich results. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.
Learning Video [VideoObject, LearningResource]

Learning Video markup is intended to give more visibility into the educational contents of the video. The markup can hold information about the various concepts and skills taught in the video.

Use the [VideoObject, LearningResource] type for Learning Videos. In addition to the VideoObject required and recommended properties, add the following properties for Learning Videos.
Required properties
educationalAlignment 	

AlignmentObject
You must provide at least one of the following properties: educationalLevel, educationalAlignment, or learningResourceType.

The official standard code, class, or exam associated with the content. Only use this property if your content is aligned with a specific standard or exam. If not, only use the educationalLevel property. If you include the educationalAlignment property, add the following properties (as applicable):

    educationalAlignment.educationalFramework
    educationalAlignment.targetName
    educationalAlignment.targetUrl

While you may provide multiple educationalAlignment values, it is not guaranteed that all of these values will be used for Learning Video features. If multiple values are provided, and the feature can only use one educationalAlignment value, the feature uses the first value that you provide.

Examples:

"educationalAlignment":
            {
              "@type": "AlignmentObject",
              "educationalFramework": "Common Core",
              "targetName": "CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.7.SP.B.4",
              "targetUrl": "https://www.corestandards.org/Math/Content/7/SP/B/4/"
            }

"educationalAlignment":
            {
              "@type": "AlignmentObject",
              "educationalFramework": "NCERT",
              "targetUrl": "https://ncert.nic.in/"
            }

educationalLevel 	

Text
You must provide at least one of the following properties: educationalLevel, educationalAlignment, or learningResourceType.

The target education level for the video. Set the target education level to either a country-specific or generic value.

Country-specific values:

Each country has its own academic system. Set the educationalLevel to one of the supported level values, based on the applicable country for the video.

Monitor rich results with Search Console

Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:

    After deploying structured data for the first time
    After releasing new templates or updating your code
    Analyzing traffic periodically

After deploying structured data for the first time

After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant Rich result status report. Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:

    Fix the invalid items.
    Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
    Request validation using the status report.

After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.

    If you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.
    If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.

Warning: Don't use cached links to debug your pages. Instead, use the URL Inspection Tool because it has the most up-to-date version of your pages.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report. The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the Search Console API.
Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

    If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
    Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.
    You might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors.
    If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.
    Review the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.
    Troubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
    Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
    Post a question in the Google Search Central forum.

Content doesn't match the structured data

error What caused the issue: A page includes content that doesn't match the structured data on the page. For example, the title of a video on the page doesn't match the value listed for the name property. There may also be spammy content, like click-baity titles and descriptions, or the markup isn't representative of the actual video. You may have received this Search Console message: "Structured data policy violation - Content on pages found to be different than structured data on the page".

done Fix the issue

    Verify that the structured data aligns with the actual content on the page.
    Use the URL Inspection tool to make sure that the content is visible on the rendered page (the rendered page is how Google sees your page).
    After you resolve the issue, submit your site for reconsideration.
