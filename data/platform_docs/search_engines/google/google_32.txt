Practice problem (Quiz) structured data

To help students, teachers and parents find your education and learning material online easier, you can use structured data to mark up practice problems. This guide explains how you can implement this schema on your web page. Adding structured data makes your practice problems eligible to appear in a special user experience in Google Search results.
Practice problems rich result in Google Search
Note: The actual appearance in search results might be different. You can preview most features with the Rich Results Test.
How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the structured data codelab.

    Add the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
    Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
    Using JavaScript? Learn how to generate structured data with JavaScript.
    Follow the guidelines.
    Validate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
    Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
    Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.

Feature availability

The practice problems feature is available in English in all regions where Google Search is available. The feature is only available for math and science topics, for multiple choice and checkbox question types, and on desktop and mobile.

Guidelines

You must follow these guidelines to be eligible to appear in the Practice problems experience on Google:

    General structured data guidelines
    Search Essentials
    Technical guidelines
    Content guidelines

Technical guidelines

    Put structured data on the most detailed leaf page possible. Don't add structured data to pages without practice problems.
    Add a Quiz property for each practice problem that you want to be featured. The structured data must appear on the same page as the practice problem a user can interact with on your web page.
    Your web page includes all required structured data properties.
    You must mark up a minimum of two practice problems per topic (for example, two practice problems for the concept "quadratic equation"). Focus on marking up the concepts and problems that you want to be eligible to appear in the Practice Problem rich result. They can be on separate pages.
    The practice problems on your site must be accessible to users, meaning not held only in a data file or PDF.
    Ensure that your host load settings allow for frequent crawls.
    If you have several copies of the same practice problem on your site hosted under different URLs, use canonical URLs on each copy of the page.
    For text-only practice problems:
        The question must be limited to 320 characters max.
        Multiple choice answers must be limited to 70 characters max, per answer.
    For practice problems with text and an image:
        The question must be limited to 160 characters max.
        The image max height must be 200px.
    Accessibility: We don't allow practice problems that are hidden behind a login or paywall. Once users navigate from the feature on Google to your site, the practice problem content must be accessible to them. Additional content can be behind a login or paywall.
    Misrepresentation: We don't allow practice problems that are intended to deceive or mislead users. This includes inaccurately marking up topics that are unassociated to the question.

Content guidelines

We created these Practice problems content guidelines to ensure that our users are connected with learning resources that are relevant. If we find content that violates these policies, we'll respond appropriately, which may include taking manual action and removing your pages from appearing in the practice problems experience on Google.
Profanity and vulgar language

We don't allow practice problems that contain obscene, profane, or offensive language.
Advertisements disguised as a practice problem

We don't allow promotional content disguised as a practice problem, such as those posted by a third party (for example, affiliate programs).
Legal removal requests

If Google receives a complaint that content in a practice problem may violate the law, the content will be handled in accordance with Search policies.
Quality

    You are responsible for the accuracy and quality of your practice problems through this feature. If a certain amount of your data is found to be inaccurate based on our quality review processes, then either all or a subset of your problems may be removed from the feature until you resolve the issues depending on the severity. This applies to the accuracy of:
        The concept marked up as it relates to the question being asked
        Question, answer choice, hint, and answer explanation formatting and accuracy
        Correct order of answers (for example, don't put "None of the above" as the first option)
        Image or formula quality and accuracy as it relates to the question
        Symbolic math rendering and delimiter implementation

Mark up educational standards

Learning standards are the learning goals for what students should know and be able to do at each grade level. Learning standards have multiple uses, such as linking to content or making up a part of a learning progression. Marking up the standards (found under the educationalAlignment and hasPart.educationalAlignment fields) associated with online learning material helps Google organize and surface the information in the most useful way to people who may Search for learning content based on these standards. Here's a high-level overview of the schema:

Here are a few examples of standards:

    Common Core State Standards
    Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS)
    Virginia Standards of Learning (SOL)
    BC Performance Standards
    Alberta Programs of Studies
    The Australian Curriculum (ACARA)
    The Victorian Curriculum (F-10)
    UK National Curriculum

Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information to your structured data, which could provide a better user experience.

Encoding practice problems in HTML or Markdown

Google Search supports Markdown (CommonMark flavor) and HTML when encoding Question, Answer, and Comment. We restrict the set of constructs to:

    Headers
    Line breaks
    Lists (ordered and unordered)
    Paragraphs
    Bold
    Italic
    Images
    Formulas in LaTex

CSS or JavaScript is ignored. Google won't display questions that contain unsupported HTML tags.
How to specify the format

To specify which encoding format you're using, use the encodingFormat property and set the value to either "text/html" for HTML or "text/markdown" for Markdown.

Here's an example of a question that's set to the Markdown format:

{
  "@type": "Question",
  "name": "Average velocity and average speed from graphs",
  "text": "What is the average velocity [..] between the times $$t = 4s$$ and $$t = 10s$$?",
  "encodingFormat": "text/markdown"
  ..
  ..
}

If no encodingFormat is specified, "text/html" is assumed.
Formulas

To specify a formula, use the LaTex format. You must use the double dollar sign ($$) to embed formulas. For example:

"Please solve: $$2x^2 = 18$$"

Important: Rich Results Test will show warnings for long or complex math expressions without formula delimiters.
Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

    If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
    Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.
    You might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors.
    If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.
    Review the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.
    Troubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
    Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
    Post a question in the Google Search Central forum.
