Recipe (Recipe, HowTo, ItemList) structured data
Does your page provide instructions for something other than food or drinks? Add HowTo structured data instead of Recipe.

Help users find your recipe content by telling Google about your recipe with structured data. When you provide information such as reviewer ratings, cooking and preparation times, and nutrition information, Google can better understand your recipe and present it to users in interesting ways. Recipes can appear in Google Search results and Google Images.

It contains 4 rich results from different websites, with details about how long it takes to cook the recipe, an image, and review information. An illustration of how a recipes can appear in Google Images. There are 6 images results showing different food items, with 3 results containing a recipe badge that tells the user it's a recipe

Based on how you mark up your content, your recipes can be eligible for the following enhancements:
Recipe enhancements
Guided Recipes: Enable the Google Assistant to guide users through your recipes on Google Home and smart displays by adding Recipe structured data. There are a few additional properties that are required for Guided Recipes, but only recommended for Google Search. Make sure you add recipeIngredient and recipeInstructions. If you add the video property, you must also add the contentUrl property.

It shows 3 different recipes from the same website in a carousel format that users can explore and select a specific recipe
How to add structured data

Structured data is a standardized format for providing information about a page and classifying the page content. If you're new to structured data, you can learn more about how structured data works.

Here's an overview of how to build, test, and release structured data. For a step-by-step guide on how to add structured data to a web page, check out the structured data codelab.

    Add the required properties. Based on the format you're using, learn where to insert structured data on the page.
    Using a CMS? It may be easier to use a plugin that's integrated into your CMS.
    Using JavaScript? Learn how to generate structured data with JavaScript.
    Follow the guidelines.
    Validate your code using the Rich Results Test and fix any critical errors. Consider also fixing any non-critical issues that may be flagged in the tool, as they can help improve the quality of your structured data (however, this isn't necessary to be eligible for rich results).
    Deploy a few pages that include your structured data and use the URL Inspection tool to test how Google sees the page. Be sure that your page is accessible to Google and not blocked by a robots.txt file, the noindex tag, or login requirements. If the page looks okay, you can ask Google to recrawl your URLs.
    Note: Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it.
    To keep Google informed of future changes, we recommend that you submit a sitemap. You can automate this with the Search Console Sitemap API.

Examples

Here are some examples of recipes using JSON-LD code.
Note: The actual appearance in Search results might be different. Preview the structured data in the Rich Results Test for the most up-to-date layout.

Guidelines

You must follow the general structured data guidelines for your recipe to be eligible to appear in Search results. If you want your recipe to display as a Guided Recipe on the Assistant, make sure your content follows the content restrictions policy for the Assistant.
If you violate these policies, your recipe might not show up as a rich result, but your content will still appear in Search results. Read about Spammy Structured Markup.

The following guidelines apply to Recipe structured data.

    Use Recipe structured data for content about preparing a particular dish. For example, "facial scrub" or "party ideas" are not valid names for a dish.
    To enable your recipes to appear in a carousel or grid, you must follow these guidelines:
        Provide ItemList structured data to summarize the recipes for your list. You can provide ItemList structured data separately or together with recipe structured data.
        Your site must have a summary page that lists all the recipes in the collection. For example, when a user clicks the summary link from Search results, they are properly directed to a page on your site listing the recipes related to their search.

Structured data type definitions

You must include the required properties for your content to be eligible for display as a rich result in Google Search. You can also include the recommended properties to add more information about your content, which could provide a better user experience.
If you want your recipe to display as a Guided Recipe on the Assistant, make sure you add recipeIngredient and recipeInstructions. If you add the video property, you must also add the contentUrl property. If your recipe doesn't have these properties, the recipe won't eligible for Guided Recipes (but may still be eligible to appear in Search results).
Recipe

Mark up your recipe content with the following properties of the schema.org Recipe type. The full definition of Recipe is available at schema.org/Recipe. The Google-supported properties are the following:
Required properties
image 	

URL or ImageObject

Image of the completed dish.

Additional image guidelines:

    Every page must contain at least one image (whether or not you include markup). Google will pick the best image to display in Search results based on the aspect ratio and resolution.
    Image URLs must be crawlable and indexable. To check if Google can access your URLs, use the URL Inspection tool.
    Images must represent the marked up content.
    Images must be in a file format that's supported by Google Images.
    For best results, we recommend providing multiple high-resolution images (minimum of 50K pixels when multiplying width and height) with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.

For example:

"image": [
  "https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
  "https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
  "https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"
]

Recommended properties
aggregateRating 	

AggregateRating

Annotation for the average review score assigned to the item. Follow the Review snippet guidelines and list of required and recommended AggregateRating properties.

If the Recipe structured data contains a single review, the reviewer's name must be a valid person or organization. For example, "50% off ingredients" is not a valid name for a reviewer.

    Don't use a tag that's actually a recipeCategory or recipeCuisine.

    Not recommended:

    "keywords": "dessert, American"

    Recommended:

    "keywords": "winter apple pie, nutmeg crust"

nutrition.calories 	

Energy

The number of calories in each serving produced with this recipe. If nutrition.calories is defined, recipeYield must be defined with the number of servings.

  "6 cups thinly sliced, peeled apples (6 medium)",
  "3/4 cup sugar",
  "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
  "3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
  "1/4 teaspoon salt",
  "1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
  "1 tablespoon lemon juice"
]

Additional guidelines:

    Include only the ingredient text that is necessary for making the recipe.
    Don't include unnecessary information, such as a definition of the ingredient.

recipeInstructions 	

HowToStep, HowToSection, or Text
This property is required for Guided Recipes.

The steps to make the dish.

There are several options for setting the value of recipeInstructions. We recommend using HowToStep. HowToSection can also be used to group HowToSteps when the recipe has sections.

    HowToStep: Specify this recipe's steps with HowToStep.

    "recipeInstructions": [
      {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Preheat",
        "text": "Heat oven to 425°F.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step1",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step1.jpg"
      }, {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Prepare crust",
        "text": "Place 1 pie crust in ungreased 9-inch glass pie plate, pressing firmly against side and bottom.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step2",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step2.jpg"
      }, {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Make filling",
        "text": "In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step3",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step3.jpg"
      }, {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Cover",
        "text": "Top with second crust. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step4",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step4.jpg"
      }, {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Bake",
        "text": "Bake 40 to 45 minutes. The pie is ready when the apples are tender and the crust is golden brown.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step5",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step5.jpg"
      }, {
        "@type": "HowToStep",
        "name": "Cool",
        "text": "Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours before serving.",
        "url": "https://example.com/recipe#step6",
        "image": "https://example.com/photos/recipe/step6.jpg"
      }
    ]

    HowToSection (only if a recipe has multiple sections): Use to group steps into multiple sections. See HowToSection for an example.
    Single or repeated property of text: A block of text that includes one or more steps. Google treats all steps as being in a single section. Repeated property values are concatenated into a single block of text. Google then attempts to automatically split the single block of text into individual steps. Google tries to find and remove any section names, step numbers, keywords, and anything else that can incorrectly appear in recipe step text. For best results, we recommend you unambiguously specify steps with HowToStep.

    "recipeInstructions": [
      "In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie
    plate. Top with second crust. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top
    crust. Bake 40 to 45 minutes. The pie is ready when the or until apples are
    tender and the crust is golden brown. Cool on cooling rack at least 2 hours
    before serving."
    ]

Additional guidelines

    Don't include metadata that belongs elsewhere. In particular, use the author property to specify the author, recipeCuisine for cuisine, recipeCategory for category, and keywords for other keywords.
    Include only text on how to make the dish and don't include other text such as "Directions", "Watch the video", "Step 1". Specify those phrases outside of structured data.

    Not recommended:

    "recipeInstructions": [{
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Step 1. Heat oven to 425°F."
    }]

    Recommended:

    "recipeInstructions": [{
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat oven to 425°F."
    }]

recipeYield 	

Text or Integer
For Guided Recipes, the type must be Integer.

The quantity produced by the recipe. Specify the number of servings produced from this recipe with just a number. If you wish to use a different unit (for example, number of items), you may include additional yields. This is required if you specify any nutritional information per serving (such as nutrition.calories).

Example

"recipeYield": [
  "6",
  "24 cookies"
]

totalTime 	

Duration

The total time it takes to prepare the cook the dish, in ISO 8601 format.

Use totalTime or a combination of both cookTime and prepTime.

video.contentUrl 	

URL
The contentUrl property is required for Guided Recipes.

A URL pointing to the actual video media file, in one of the supported encoding formats. Don't link to the page where the video lives; this must be the URL of the video media file itself.

"contentUrl": "https://www.example.com/video/123/file.mp4"

Make sure to follow our Video best practices.
Tip: You can ensure that only Googlebot accesses your content by using a reverse DNS lookup.
video.hasPart 	

Clip

A video clip that is part of the entire video.
video.hasPart.endOffset 	

Number

The end time of the clip expressed as the number of seconds from the beginning of the video.
video.hasPart.name 	

Text

The name of the clip. For example, "Arrange pie crust" could be the name of the clip that shows how to arrange and press the pie crust into the pie plate.
video.hasPart.startOffset 	

Number

The start time of the clip expressed as the number of seconds from the beginning of the video.
video.hasPart.url 	

URL

A link to the start of the clip. The start of the clip must match the value set in video.hasPart.startOffset. For example:

"startOffset": 20,
"endOffset": 29,
"url": "https://www.example.com/example?t=20"

HowToSection
Most recipes don't have sections. Start by splitting the recipe instructions into HowToStep properties, and only add HowToSection if you need to additionally specify sections of steps.

Use HowToSection to group a sequence of steps (or sub-sections) that make up part of the instructions for a recipe. Specify HowToSection directly within the definition of recipeInstructions property, or as an itemListElement of another HowToSection.

The HowToSection type defines a section of a single recipe and contains one or multiple steps. Don't use HowToSection to define different recipes for the same dish; instead, use HowToSection as part of a single recipe. For listing multiple recipes for a dish, use multiple Recipe objects. For example, for multiple ways to make an apple pie, list them as multiple Recipe objects, not HowToSection objects.

The full definition of HowToSection is available at schema.org/HowToSection.
Required properties
itemListElement 	HowToStep

A list of detailed steps for the section, and/or sub-sections. For example, a pizza recipe may have one section of steps for making the crust, one for preparing the toppings, and one for combining and baking. If a recipe has sections, but they aren't defined with HowToSections, the Assistant may mistakenly present the section name as just another step (for example, a "Make the crust" step followed by a "Combine the flour and yeast" step).

Example:

{
  "@type": "HowToSection",
  "name": "Assemble the pie",
  "itemListElement": [
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In large bowl, gently mix filling ingredients; spoon into crust-lined pie plate."
    }, {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Top with second crust. Cut slits or shapes in several places in top crust."
    }
  ]
}

name 	Text

The name of the section.
HowToStep

Use HowToStep to group one or more sentences that explain how to do part of the recipe. Define the text property with the sentences or, alternately, define itemListElement with a HowToDirection or HowToTip for each sentence.

Mark up your recipe steps with the following properties of the HowToStep type. Specify a HowToStep directly within the definition of recipeInstructions property, or as an itemListElement of a HowToSection.

The full definition of HowToStep is available at schema.org/HowToStep.
Required properties
itemListElement 	HowToDirection or HowToTip

A list of detailed substeps, including directions or tips.

Optional if text is used.
text 	Text

The full instruction text of this step.

Optional if itemListElement is used. Additional guidelines:

    Include only instructional text and don't include other text such as "Directions", "Watch the video", "Step 1". Specify those phrases outside of the marked up property.

    Not recommended:

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Step 1. Heat oven to 425°F."
    }

    Recommended:

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat oven to 425°F."
    }

Recommended properties
image 	ImageObject or URL

An image for the step. Additional image guidelines:

    Image URLs must be crawlable and indexable.
    Images must represent the marked up content.
    Images must be in .jpg, .png, or. gif format.

name 	Text

The word or short phrase summarizing the step (for example, "Arrange pie crust"). Don't use non-descriptive text (for example, "Step 1: [text]") or other form of step number (for example, "1. [text]").
url 	URL

A URL that directly links to the step (if one is available). For example, an anchor link fragment.
video 	VideoObject or Clip

A video for this step or a clip of the video.

For VideoObject, follow the list of required and recommended Video or Clip properties.
The contentUrl property is required for Guided Recipes.
HowToDirection and HowToTip

Use HowToDirection and HowToTip to describe directions or tips. They have the same required and recommended properties.

The full definitions of HowToDirection and HowToTip are available at schema.org/HowToDirection and schema.org/HowToTip.
Required properties
text 	Text

The text of the direction or tip.
ItemList

In addition to Recipe properties, add the following properties for host-specific lists. While ItemList isn't required, you must add the following properties if you want your recipe to be eligible for a host carousel. For more information about host carousel, see Carousel.

The full definition of ItemList is available at schema.org/ItemList.
Required properties
itemListElement 	

ListItem

Annotation for a single item page.
ListItem.position 	

Integer

Ordinal position of the item page in the list. For example:

"itemListElement": [
  {
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 1,
  }, {
    "@type": "ListItem",
    "position": 2,
  }
]

ListItem.url 	

URL

The canonical URL of the item page. Every item must have a unique URL.
Monitor rich results with Search Console

Search Console is a tool that helps you monitor how your pages perform in Google Search. You don't have to sign up for Search Console to be included in Google Search results, but it can help you understand and improve how Google sees your site. We recommend checking Search Console in the following cases:

    After deploying structured data for the first time
    After releasing new templates or updating your code
    Analyzing traffic periodically

After deploying structured data for the first time

After Google has indexed your pages, look for issues using the relevant Rich result status report. Ideally, there will be an increase of valid items, and no increase in invalid items. If you find issues in your structured data:

    Fix the invalid items.
    Inspect a live URL to check if the issue persists.
    Request validation using the status report.

After releasing new templates or updating your code
When you make significant changes to your website, monitor for increases in structured data invalid items.

    If you see an increase in invalid items, perhaps you rolled out a new template that doesn't work, or your site interacts with the existing template in a new and bad way.
    If you see a decrease in valid items (not matched by an increase in invalid items), perhaps you are no longer embedding structured data in your pages. Use the URL Inspection tool to learn what is causing the issue.

Warning: Don't use cached links to debug your pages. Instead, use the URL Inspection Tool because it has the most up-to-date version of your pages.
Analyzing traffic periodically
Analyze your Google Search traffic using the Performance Report. The data will show you how often your page appears as a rich result in Search, how often users click on it and what is the average position you appear on search results. You can also automatically pull these results with the Search Console API.
Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble implementing or debugging structured data, here are some resources that may help you.

    If you're using a content management system (CMS) or someone else is taking care of your site, ask them to help you. Make sure to forward any Search Console message that details the issue to them.
    Google does not guarantee that features that consume structured data will show up in search results. For a list of common reasons why Google may not show your content in a rich result, see the General Structured Data Guidelines.
    You might have an error in your structured data. Check the list of structured data errors.
    If you received a structured data manual action against your page, the structured data on the page will be ignored (although the page can still appear in Google Search results). To fix structured data issues, use the Manual Actions report.
    Review the guidelines again to identify if your content isn't compliant with the guidelines. The problem can be caused by either spammy content or spammy markup usage. However, the issue may not be a syntax issue, and so the Rich Results Test won't be able to identify these issues.
    Troubleshoot missing rich results / drop in total rich results.
    Allow time for re-crawling and re-indexing. Remember that it may take several days after publishing a page for Google to find and crawl it. For general questions about crawling and indexing, check the Google Search crawling and indexing FAQ.
    Post a question in the Google Search Central forum.
