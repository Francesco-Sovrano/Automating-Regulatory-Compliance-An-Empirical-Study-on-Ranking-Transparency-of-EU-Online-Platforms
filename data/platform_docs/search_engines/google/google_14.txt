Top Places List

If your business is mentioned in any "top places" lists online, Google might show a rich result that shows the lists that mention your business. For example, if your restaurant appears in a "Top 10 Chinese restaurants in NYC" list and a "Best restaurants in the city" list on qualified websites, these lists would be shown in your business's search result. This feature is only for businesses with a physical location.
