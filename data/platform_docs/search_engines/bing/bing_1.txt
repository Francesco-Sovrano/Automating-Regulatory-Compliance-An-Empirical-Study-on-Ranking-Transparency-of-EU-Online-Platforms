Bing Webmaster Guidelines

These guidelines are intended to help you understand how Bing finds, indexes, and ranks websites.
Following these guidelines will help with indexing of your site on Bing. It will also help you optimize your site to increase its opportunity to rank for relevant queries in Bing’s search results. Please pay special attention to the guidance in the “Abuse section” and examples in the “Things to avoid” section. Following the guidelines will ensure your site plays by the rules and is not found to be spammy, which could lead to demotion or even delisting your website from Bing search results.
How Bing finds and indexes your site

Help Bing find all your pages

Sitemaps: Sitemaps are an essential way for Bing to discover URLs and content for your website. It is a file that provides information about the URLs, other files, and content such as images and videos on your website. The sitemap informs the crawler about pages and files you believe are important within your site. It also provides additional information, such as when the page was last updated. We strongly recommend using an XML sitemap file to help Bing discover all the relevant URLs and content within your website. Please keep your sitemap files as up-to-date as possible; refreshing them in real-time or at least once a day. This will enable the timely removal of old URLs and deadlinks once the content is removed from your website. 

Make your sitemap available to Bing by:
1. Submitting it to Bing using the Bing Webmaster Tools Sitemap tool
2. Inserting the following line in the robots.txt file, specifying the path to your sitemap:
3. Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap_location.xml
4. Once Bing knows your sitemap, Bing will crawl it regularly. There is no need to submit it again except in case of significant changes on the site.

General sitemap guidelines:
1. Bing supports several sitemap formats including XML, RSS, MRSS, Atom 1.0, and a text file.
2. Use consistent URLs. Bing will only crawl the URLs precisely as listed.
3. Please only list canonical URLs in your sitemaps.
4. If your website has multiple versions (HTTP vs HTTPS, or mobile vs desktop), we recommend only pointing to a single version in your sitemap. If you decide to have a unique URL experience for mobile vs desktop, please annotate with the rel="alternate" attribute.
5. If you have multiple pages for different languages or regions, please use the hreflang tags in either the sitemap or the HTML tag to identify the alternate URLs.
6. Use the <lastmod> attribute to indicate the date and time when the content was last modified.
7. The maximum sitemap size is 50,000 URLs/50MB uncompressed. If your site is large, consider breaking up large sitemaps into smaller sitemaps and, then use a sitemap index file to list all individual sitemaps.
8. Refer to your sitemap in the robots.txt file.
9. If you have not changed your sitemap since Bing crawled it there is no need or benefit to resubmitting it.

Using a sitemap does not guarantee that all items within a sitemap will be crawled and indexed; however, in most cases you will benefit by having a sitemap as it provides a recommendation and guidance to the crawler.

Use IndexNow API or the Bing URL or Content Submission API to instantly reflect website changes. If you are unable to adopt the APIs, we recommend submitting the updated URLs directly through Bing Webmaster Tools or by including them in your sitemap.

Links: Links are traditionally regarded as a signal for determining website popularity. The best way to get other sites to link to your site is to create unique and high quality and unique content. Bing’s crawler (Bingbot) follows links within your website (internal links) or from other sites (external links) to help Bing discover new content and new pages. 

Bing recommends linking all pages on a site to at least one other discoverable and crawlable page.
Crawlable links are <a> tags with an href attribute. The referring link should include either a text or an image alt attribute that is relevant to the page.
Limit the number of links on a page to a reasonable quantity, no more than a few thousand links per page.
Make a reasonable effort to ensure that any paid or advertisement links on your site use rel="nofollow" or rel="sponsored" or rel="ugc" attribute to prevent the links from being followed by a crawler and from potentially impacting search rankings.
Bing rewards links that have grown organically; links added over time by content creators on other trusted, relevant websites that drive real users from their site to yours. Plan to build links both internally and externally, in an organic manner.

Abusive tactics that aim to inflate the number and nature of inbound links, such as links buying participating in link schemes (link farms, link spamming and excessive link manipulation) can lead to your site being penalized and delisted from the Bing index.

Limit the number of web pages: Limit the number of pages on your website to a reasonable number. Avoid duplicative content within your site; help us dedupe duplicate content by:
1. Avoid outputting different URLs with the same content by using the Canonical Tag.
2. Configuring your website and URL Parameters to improve crawl efficiency and help reduce multiple variations of the same URL pointing to the same content.
3. Avoid mobile-specific URLs. Try using the same URL for desktop and mobile users.

Use redirects as appropriate: If you move content on your website to another location, use a HTTP 301 permanent redirect for at least three months. If the move is temporary, i.e. less than one day, use a 302 temporary redirect. Avoid using a rel=canonical tag in place of a proper redirect when site content has moved from one location to another.

Let Bing crawl more: The Webmaster Tool's crawl control feature allows you to manage how Bingbot crawls your content, including when, and at what pace. We encourage Webmasters to enable Bingbot to quickly and deeply crawl sites to ensure as much content as possible is discovered and indexed. 

JavaScript:Bingcan process JavaScript, however, there are limitations to processing JavaScript at scale while minimizing the number of HTTP requests. Bing recommends Dynamic Rendering to switch between client-side rendered and pre-rendered content for specific user agents such as Bingbot, especially large web sites.

Remove content by returning a 404 "Not Found" HTTP code. Expedite content removal by using the Bing Content Removal and Page Removal tools. Content removal requests last for a maximum of 90 days, and you need to renew it, or content may reappear in the search results.

robots.txt: A robots.txt file informs search engine crawlers such as Bingbot, which pages and files the crawler can or cannot access on your site. Robots.txt is primarily used to instruct and manage crawler traffic, For example you can tell Bingbot not to crawl less helpful content such as search result pages or login pages.
Place the robots.txt in your root directory (the topmost directory) of your website. Do not place it in a subdirectory.
Blocking Bing from crawling a page will likely remove the page from the index. However, using Disallow does not guarantee that a page will not appear within the index or search results. If you would like to block a specific page from getting crawled or indexed, you should use the noindex robots meta tag instead of disallowing it in the robots.txt.
Review your robots.txt often to ensure it's up to date. Review URLs disallowed by robots.txt in Bing Webmaster Tools to ensure it remains accurate.
Learn more by reading how to create a robots.txt text file

Save resources: Use HTTP Compression and Conditional Get to reduce bandwidth used by the crawlers and your customers while improving page load speed.
Help Bing understand your pages

Bing seeks rich, valuable, and engaging content created for users, not search engines. By creating clear, unique, high-quality, relevant, and easy-to-find content on your website, you will increase the probability of Bing indexing and showing your content in search results.
Content: Websites that are thin on content, show ads or affiliate links primarily, or redirect visitors away to other sites quickly tend to drop in rankings on Bing. In some cases, it may not get indexed at all. Your content should be easy to navigate, rich and engaging to the website visitor, and provide the information they seek. 

Create content for search users not search engines: Develop rich content based on keyword research that shows what search users the information they are looking for.

Create enough content to meet the visitor’s expectations entirely. There are no hard and fast rules on the number of words per page, but providing more relevant content is usually better..

Make it unique. Do not reuse content from other sources. Content on your page must be unique in its final form. If you choose to host content from a third party, either use the canonical tag (rel="canonical" to identify the original source or use the alternate tag (rel="alternate") .

Images and Videos: Use unique and original images and videos relevant to the topic of the page. Bing can extract information from images, captions, structured data, titles, and related text such as transcripts.
Do not embed important text or information within images or videos. Optical Character Recognition is less reliable than HTML text, and it is not accessible. Alt text improves accessibility for people and devices that cannot see images on pages. When choosing alt text, focus on creating information-rich content that uses keywords appropriately to give context to the image related to the content of the page.
Include descriptive titles, filenames, and text for images and videos.
The videos must be in a supported format and not blocked behind paywall protection or logins.
Subtitles and captions can be used for videos to help make your content available to a broader audience and provide search engines a textual representation of the content in video and audio files.
Choose high-quality photos and videos; they appeal more to users than blurry or out-of-focus images.

Optimize images and videos to improve page load times. Images are often the most significant contributor to page size and slower page loads.

SafeSearch is a setting that specifies whether to show or hide explicit images, videos, and websites in search results. Bing uses machine learning to help categorize images. However the strongest signal is self-marked adult pages and content. We recommend you help Bing understand Adult-Only images and content by:
1. Using <meta name ="rating" content="adult">
2. Grouping adult-only images in a common file folder: http://www.example.com/adult/image.png

Make your content discoverable. Avoid housing content inside Flash or JavaScript – these block crawlers from finding content. 

Make content accessible and easy to navigate for all site visitors: Test the usability for devices such as screen readers. Listening to your content instead of looking at it can be eye-opening and help you check the accuracy and quality of the alt text for images and videos. Testing for usability can also help identify issues and problems with navigation, reading order, table markup and form elements within your website.
HTML Tags: Ensure your HTML element and alt attributes are descriptive, specific, and accurate.
<TITLE> tags – Title of the page. Write descriptive and unique titles for each page of your website. 

<META name="description"> – This is the summary and description of the webpage and may appear as the page description in the search results. Write relevant descriptions; you can use this space to expand on the <title> tag. 

<META name="robots"> – You can provide crawling instructions to crawlers on indexing specific page content using these. Using robots meta tag, you can let Bing know about your snippet and content preview preferences.

<a href> tag – specifies the URL linking to another page. If you want to link to another part on the same page use the #tag. 

<img src> tag –specifies an image file to be displayed 

alt attributes – use this attribute on <img> tags to describe the image. Use descriptive and information-rich context within alt attributes to provide context to the images. 

<H1> tag – helps users understand the content of a page more clearly when properly used. 

<H1>-<H6> Header tags – Define the structure of your page and helps Bing understand the content of each paragraph. 

<P> tag – delineates paragraphs. 

<TABLE> tag – Use <TABLE><TH> etc. for data tables. Do not use <TABLE> for layout. 

Use HTML5 semantic elements as they have an intrinsic meaning to browser, developer and search engine, especially use the following HTML5 Semantic Elements: <article>, <aside>, <details>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <header>, <main>, <mark>, <nav>, <section>, <summary>, <time>. 

Verify your HTML via URL Inspection tool or Markup Validation Service. 

Microsoft Edge: Make sure your web page does not appear broken in the Microsoft Edge browser. When the document is loaded, searchable content must be visible, and there should be no pop-ups on page load. 

Secondary content (CSS, JavaScript): Allow crawlers in your robots.txt. to crawl all your CSS Style Sheet and JavaScript files. Limit usage of dynamic loading of resources – i.e., AJAX to limit the number of HTTP requests and limit the use of JavaScript on large websites.

Use Semantic Markup to convey information about the pages in either Schema.org, RDFa, or OpenGraph. Schema.org is preferred, in either JSON-LD or Microdata format. Note that Semantic Markup may enable Bing's rich features to be triggered. However it does not guarantee it. Verify Schema markup on your pages using URL Inspection. 

How Bing ranks your content

Complex algorithms generate Microsoft Bing search results using the user’s search query matching it with third-party webpages in our index. Bing designs and continually improves its algorithms to provide the most comprehensive, relevant, and valuable collection of search results available.
Given the scale of the internet and the complexity of operating a search engine, Bing relies on machine learning to ensure users see the best results for their query out of the trillions of pages of content on the web. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed by identifying patterns in data and generalizing based on a small set of examples. For web ranking, this means building a model that will look at some ideal results to learn which features are most predictive of their usefulness, relying on automated signals like user interactions with the Bing website and training data labeled by human judges. Bing guides its judges to make sure their evaluations align with Bing’s ranking goals.
Below is a high-level overview of the main parameters Bing uses to rank pages in search results. These parameters are listed in general order of importance. Bing’s complex systems use these criteria to deliver search results, and the relative importance of each of the parameters below may vary from search to search and evolve overtime:
1. Relevance: Relevance refers to how closely the content on the landing page matches the intent behind the search query. This includes matching terms directly on the page and phrases used in links referring to the page. Bing also considers semantic equivalents, including synonyms or abbreviations, which may not be exact matches of the query terms but are understood to have the same meaning. Many queries may have more than one possible intent. Bing tries to provide a comprehensive set of results that reflect all possible intents. Bing presumes the user seeks high-quality, authoritative content unless the user clearly indicates an intent to find low-authority content.
2. Quality and Credibility: Determining the quality and credibility (QC) of a website includes evaluating the clarity of purpose of the site, its usability, and presentation. QC also consists of an evaluation of the page’s authoritativeness, which includes such factors as the author’s or site’s reputation, the level of discourse (for example, an article with citations and references to data sources is considered higher quality than one that does not explain or cite it’s data sources; pages that call for violence, name-calling, offensive statements, or use derogatory language to make a point are generally considered low quality), the completeness of the content, and transparency of authorship 
3. User engagement: Bing also considers how users interact with search results. To determine user engagement, Bing asks questions like: Did users click through to search results for a given query, and if so, which results? Did users spend time on these search results they clicked through or quickly return to Bing? Did the user adjust or reformulate their query? The Bing Webmaster Dashboard will provide insights into how users interact with your webpages.
4. Freshness: Generally, Bing prefers fresh content. The page that consistently provides up-to-date information is considered fresh. In many cases, content produced today will still be relevant years from now. In some cases, however, content produced today will go out of date quickly.
5. Location: In ranking results, Bing considers the user’s location (country and city), where the page is hosted, the language of the page, and the location of other visitors to the page.
6. Page load time: Slow page load times can lead a visitor to leave your website, potentially before the content has even loaded, to seek information elsewhere. Bing may view this as a poor user experience and a less helpful search result. Faster page loads are always better, but webmasters should balance absolute page load speed with a positive, useful user experience.

Bing uses information specific to an individual user to improve relevance and performance such as search history, location, language, device characteristics such as operating system, and whether a user is on a mobile device, tablet, or desktop. Users can update their location, language, and other settings via Bing Settings, and delete search history on the Privacy Dashboard.

Websites may choose to advertise on Bing through Microsoft Advertising, However, they cannot improve their organic ranking position by providing remuneration to Bing. Bing does not allow websites to improve their organic ranking positions through payment. Learn more about how paid search ads are ranked within search results.

Bing does not prioritize Microsoft products or services over third-party products and services in algorithmic search results. Outside of core algorithmic search results (the “blue links”), Bing will sometimes provide a standalone answer box or banner promoting a Microsoft product or service when relevant to the search term provided.

The characteristics of the goods or services offered on a site do not affect how Bing ranks results, except in cases where the content is potentially offensive or harmful to a user. For example, pages offering adult content are not available when users set SafeSearch to “Strict” mode. As another example, pages promoting potentially harmful content, such as where a site promotes methods of suicide or purports to sell opioids or other potentially harmful drugs, may be downranked as low authority. 

In accordance with Microsoft policies and principles, digital safety, and information integrity, we have developed a safety system including content filtering, operational monitoring, and abuse detection to provide a safe search experience for our users. In some cases, Microsoft receives requests to remove content from individuals, businesses, and governments, in limited cases, where quality, safety, user demand, relevant laws, and/or public policy concerns exist, Bing might remove results, inform users of certain risks, or provide users with options for tailoring their content. Bing limits the removal of search results to a narrow set of circumstances and conditions to avoid restricting Bing users’ access to relevant information. 
See How Bing Delivers Search Results for more details. 

In addition to core algorithmic search results, Bing offers additional features such as answers, rich result panes, and tailored search experiences like Maps, News, Images, or Shopping designed to help users get the information they need faster. These features also rely on the ranking principles and main parameters described above, but in some cases take additional considerations into account to provide users with the highest quality, most relevant results available. More details on these features are below.
Answers

Bing may enhance the results page with additional features to provide a richer search experience for some search queries. For example, if a user types “How tall is the Eiffel Tower?” Bing will respond with the answer of “300 m”. For some queries, Bing looks at search results across the web, returns a summarized answer, and links to its sources.
If the query is related to a business, Bing may return relevant information about the business, such as store hours and location. Business owners can claim and verify existing listings on Bing using Bing Places for Business (available in limited markets) to create, edit or update their listing information. In some cases, Bing may partner with third-party content providers, such as local restaurant review sites, to further enhance the user experience.
Conversation Mode and Bing Image Creator

The new Bing conversation mode builds on the existing Bing experience to provide users with a new type of search interface. Bing conversation mode generates responses using an AI model that has learned by processing a vast amount of text from the Internet. Based on the user query or prompt, the model produces an output that is coherent, relevant, and creative, according to the input and the context. The output can be a response, a web result, a poem, a story, a code, an essay, a song, or anything else that can be expressed in natural language. Bing Image Creator similarly uses an AI model that has learned by processing a vast number of images from the Internet. Based on the user prompt, the model generates an output image. The conversational model is also informed by and refines its output using available context, such as web results, feedback, and interactions, to improve its performance and accuracy. Ranking within conversation mode generally relies on the same parameters as the main web search results page.
User activity in these features is governed by the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.
Image and Video experiences

Bing’s image and video experiences provide the user with image and video results relevant to their search query, both on the main search results page and in the image and video verticals. Bing prioritizes relevance and may display an image or videos within search results based on query intent. Ranking within the image and video experiences generally rely on the same parameters as the main web search results page, i.e., relevance, quality, freshness, authority, and popularity. Ranking inputs are derived from the content meta-data and a deep learning algorithmic review of the content.
Maps

In the Bing Maps experience, users can type queries into the search bar, and the map will display a list of locations in that vicinity responsive to that search or pinpoint a particular address. Bing Maps relies on licensed and publicly available location data and uses the same ranking parameters mentioned above. Businesses can participate in the Bing Maps experience and manage their listing by registering with Bing Places.
News

Microsoft displays both licensed and crawled news content in its services.
Microsoft’s licensed news service is Microsoft Start (formally Microsoft News). Microsoft licenses news and other content from publishers that meet Microsoft Start Editorial Standards and displays the full-length article or video on the MSN.com website. Microsoft often displays the headlines and thumbnail images from Microsoft Start content on many Microsoft products, which links to the full article or video content on MSN.com. Microsoft Start content is personalized to users. Information about personalization and settings can be found in the Microsoft Privacy Statement.
Microsoft also displays news content crawled and available through the Bing search engine. In response to a user query, Bing will display relevant news search results from the web which link to the third-party websites. Bing has dedicated news home page called Bing News, showing different news categories and a dedicated news search feature where users can search only for news content.
Content that appears in Bing news search results must meet specific Bing News Publisher Guidelines, described in detail in the Bing News Publication Hub. Websites interested in being included in the Bing News index may apply through PubHub. Due to local considerations, the Bing News homepage will display only Microsoft Start licensed news content in the News vertical in some markets. Licensed content is marked by the label “powered by Microsoft Start.” Also, the Microsoft Start news feed may include Bing News search results in some areas. Bing News search results are marked by labels such as “from the web” or the Bing logo.
Bing News relies on the same main parameters described above to rank and return content within the Bing News index in response to a user query. More information on how Bing News and Microsoft Start source and rank content is available here. When the same article is available both on a third-party website and on MSN.com or Microsoft Start (as Microsoft licensed content), Bing News search results may display the Microsoft Start version of that content according to its license. This enables a more consistent, higher-quality user experience.
Shopping

In the Bing Shopping experience, the ranking may be influenced by payment from sellers participating in the Microsoft Shopping program. Users who allow Microsoft to collect and use personal data to personalize and advertise may see results in the Shopping vertical tailored to their interests; users can visit the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard to opt-in or out of personalized ads and control their data.
Bing Shopping also provides a coupons experience where coupons relevant to the user’s query are displayed. In some instances, Microsoft may receive revenue for the use of the coupons, although whether a revenue share payment will be obtained is not factored into Bing’s ranking of coupons shown to users.
Abuse and Examples of Things to Avoid

Search Engine Optimization is a legitimate practice that seeks to improve the technical and content aspects of a website, making the content easier to find, relevant, and more accessible to search engine crawlers. Most SEO practices render a website more appealing to Bing; however, performing SEO-related work does not guarantee rankings will improve or sites will receive an increase in traffic from Bing. Further, taken to extremes, some SEO practices can be abused, resulting in penalties by search engines.
These Bing Webmaster Guidelines describe only some of the most widespread forms of inappropriate, manipulative, or misleading behaviors. Sites that engage in abuse, such as the practices outlined below, are considered low quality. As a result, these sites can incur ranking penalties, have site markup ignored, and may not be selected for indexing. Microsoft may take action against your site for any inappropriate or deceptive practices, even those not described here. If you feel action is taken against your site, you can contact our support team through the Bing Webmaster Tools. Additionally, users can report abuse of any of these practices using the feedback link in the footer of bing.com after performing a search that reproduces the issue. An example of this can be seen here.

Cloaking: Cloaking is the practice of showing one version of a webpage to a search crawler like Bingbot and another to regular visitors. Showing users different content than what the crawlers see may be seen as a spam tactic and could be detrimental to your website's rankings, leading your site to be de-listed from the Bing index. Websites should be extremely cautious about responding differently to crawlers as opposed to regular visitors and should not use cloaking as a principle.

Link Schemes, Link Buying, Link Spamming: While link schemes may succeed in increasing the number of links pointing to your website, they will fail to bring quality links to your site, netting your site no positive gains. Manipulating inbound links to artificially inflate the number of links pointing to a website can lead to your site being delisted from the Bing index. 

Social media schemes: Social media schemes are similar to link farms in that they seek to artificially exploit a network effect to game Bing’s algorithm. The reality is that social media schemes are easy to see in action, and the website’s value is deprecated. One such example is auto follow. Auto follows encourage follower growth on social sites such as Twitter, and work by automatically following anyone who follows you. Over time this creates a scenario where the number of followers you have is more or less the same as the number of people following you. This does not indicate you have a strong influence. Following few people while having a high follower count would indicate a stronger influential voice.

Duplicate content: Duplicating content across multiple URLs can lead to Bing losing trust in some of those URLs over time. This issue should be managed by fixing the root cause of the problem. The rel=canonical element can also be used but should be considered a secondary solution to fixing the core problem. If excessive parameterization is causing the duplicate content issue, we encourage you to use the URL Inspection tool. 

Scraped Content: Scraping or copying content from other more reputable websites may not add value to your users and may be considered copyright infringement. Instead of republishing content from other sites without adding any original content or value, you should create original content differentiating your website. Slightly modifying and republishing content from other websites also constitutes scraping. 

Keyword Stuffing OR loading pages with irrelevant keywords: When creating content, make sure to create your content for real users and readers, not to entice search engines to rank your content better. Stuffing your content with specific keywords with the sole intent of artificially inflating the probability of ranking for particular search terms is in violation of our guidelines. It can lead to demotion or even delisting your website from our search results.

Automatically generated content: Machine-generated content is information that is generated by an automated computer process, application, or other mechanisms without any active intervention of a human. Content like this is considered malicious and usually contains garbage text only created to garnish a higher ranking. This type of content will result in penalties.

Affiliate programs without adding sufficient value: Websites that link products from other websites (such as Amazon, eBay, etc.) but pretend that they are an official retailer or in affiliation with those sites are called Thin Affiliation sites, and they add little to no incremental value (like extra reviews, search functionality, Editor’s Choice, etc.). and are only intended to take credit for other content. It can lead to demotion or even delisting your website from our search results.

Malicious behavior: When creating content and managing your site, make sure to not participate in phishing or installing viruses, trojans, or other badware by verifying your content, maintaining your Content Management System, keeping your operating system up to date, and limiting access to who can publish on your site. Malicious behavior can lead to demotion or even delisting your website from our search results.

Misleading structured data markup: Site with markups must be accurate and representative of the page that the tags are on. Sites must not have markup which is irrelevant to the page and is inaccurate or misleading.
