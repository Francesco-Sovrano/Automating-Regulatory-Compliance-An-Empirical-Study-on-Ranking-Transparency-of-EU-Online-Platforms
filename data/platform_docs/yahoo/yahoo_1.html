<h1>Get a higher website rank</h1>

<p>The best way to improve your website's ranking is to publish unique content targeted to your audience. Following these guidelines can also help your pages be more easily found.</p>

<h1>Best practices for website content</h1>

<p>Key terms - When building your website's text and pages, it's a good idea to research and use key terms that your audience uses to search for your type of content.</p>

<p>Accurate page titles - Choose terms for your page titles that match the content of your documents. Users are more likely to click a link if the title matches their search.</p>

<p>Avoid text in images - Keep relevant text and links in HTML. Encoding your text in graphics or image maps can prevent search engines from finding the text or following links to your website's other pages.</p>

<p>ALT text for images - ALT text improves the searchability of the image content of your pages. It also makes your pages more accessible to text-only browsers and visually impaired site visitors.</p>

<p>Meaningful cross-links - Meaningful links between your's and other related websites and providers of relevant content add value for visitors and can boost your ranking.</p>

<p>Readable URLs - Use URLs that represent the content pages, instead of numeric or otherwise cryptic URLs.</p>

<p>Unhide content that's behind JavaScript - Content that's available only through JavaScript should be presented to non-JavaScript user agents and crawlers with noscript HTML elements.</p>

<h1>Robots Metadata</h1>

<p>Use a "Description" meta-tag and write your description accurately and carefully. After the title, the description is the most important draw for users. Make sure the document title and description attract the interest of the user as well as match the content on your site.</p>

<p>Learn about using robots metadata.</p>

<h1>Advanced</h1>

<p>Add a sitemap and link to it from your welcome page, to help make sure all your webpages are crawled. Learn how to submit a sitemap to Yahoo Search via robots.txt.
Since the organic search listings on Yahoo Search are powered in part by Bing, it's helpful to familiarize yourself with the tools available in the Bing Webmaster Center.</p>
